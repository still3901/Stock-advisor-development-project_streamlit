2023-01-27,"NVDA up 80% from yearly lows. What justifies such a radical price change? NVDA reached prices of $110 a share, and Reddit had completely lost faith in the company. Was this just an emotional response from gamers saying their new 4000 series GPUs were overpriced? Where did this sudden spike in price originate from since October? Venture capital and software/cloud companies are dumping billions into AI dev. It probably doesn't make up for the lost crypto/gaming business but it's got mindshare. The fundamentals though do not justify the PE. It's over valued. Yeah it definitely seems over valued. I have no uncertainty that NVIDIA is going to reap the benefits of AI in the long term whenever it does get implemented on a wide scale, but this is probably too premature for such a large spike and I'd place my bets on it dipping for a bit when investors become impatient. I think the hype for AI is overdue as for Nvidia. They dominated the training chip for sure, but the majority of growth would come from inference chip market, which they has a much smaller part of the pie Momentum. Stock was being shorted heavily and buyers were spooked. Once shorts lost steam buyers saw an oversold stock and piled in. Momentum swinging the other way. A volatile stock in a volatile market right now. Similar moves with Netflix and Tesla. When Algos drive up the market, retail fomo in. When the rally ends, Algos make money and retails lose money Lots of tech is running hot atm, hear lots of tsla bulls saying TSLA will be $300-500 EOY. Seems unsustainable imo, also a flashback to 2 years ago. When it was at it's lows, too many people were on one side of the boat. Now there are probably too many people on the other side of the boat. Nothing. Nvidia is running on hot air just like last year. The 4000 series GPUs are not selling like hotcake the way the 3000 series GPUs were. Disclaimer: I shorted 800 shares of Nvidia last year (400 shares at $278 and another 400 at $286). Earlier this year, I bought a few shares around $130 and sold them for a modest $800 profit during the last run up. This time, I just shorted 200 shares between today and yesterday. Who knows how the earning on 02/22 would be but most likely it won't be $200/share good. The main part of Nvidia that's of interest these days from an investment pov is their data center business though, not their consumer cards Data center is already the biggest part of their business by far, and it's managed to keep growing while their consumer business saw a drastic contraction",0
2023-02-23,"NVDA: another painful lesson in selling I've said numerous times in this sub that my most painful mistake over my investing career by far has been selling prematurely. But I'm human, and I still occasionally make the same stupid mistake.  I bought NVDA a year ago at around $234. I watched in horror as it dropped to a low of almost $110, but I patiently held on . Then it started to rebound nicely late last year but I started getting concerned . So I decided to cut my losses around $160. And here we are back right to my purchase price Yet another painful reminder that for long term investors, the only reason to sell (unless you really need the capital) is if the thesis for making the investment in the first place no longer applies. Don't sell because of macro concerns, hypothetical risks, or because of valuation. Maybe it?셲 a sign to buy in again at $234 and get tested when it hits $160 lol A great way to confirm whether op has actually learned their ""lesson."" This is the buy high, sell low trap we all fall into. I have done the same in the past. Especially with tech stocks, they are always priced on future growth, so market cap is always high. It looks like some ""news"" of the future is driving the price way up now. At the end of the day we won't know exactly how the market will react, and we can only make educated guesses. What I have learned is if the stock looks overvalued to me, I ignore the FOMO and just stay out. Keep DCA into your index/mutual fund, and for single stocks only buy if it looks like a great deal, ie. as you mentioned Nvidia was down to $110 at one point, which was maybe a good time to buy and DCA. Right now it looks super expensive(more than 50% market cap of amazon), but I can be wrong on this also. 1/2 the market cap of Google with 1/12 the revenue ND 1/12 net income??$NVDA ?쏷he stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient??-- Warren Buffet. Omg I haven?셳 heard that line ever in the 30 years I?셶e worked in the markets and invested. Thanks for sharing that is fantastic. HAVE MORE FOCUS ON BEING A LONG TERM HOLDER Because once it gets to $230, there's absolutely no way it can go back to $160. ""I've said numerous times in this sub that my most painful mistake over my investing career by far has been selling prematurely. But I'm human, and I still occasionally make the same stupid mistake"" Yes, it would be wonderful to know when precisely the right time is to sell a stock...however in the real world that is easier said than done ""Yet another painful reminder that for long term investors, the only reason to sell (unless you really need the capital) is if the thesis for making the investment in the first place no longer applies."" Or...you've made significant gains and quite rightly, want to realise them",-2

2023-05-15," Why did $NVDA go down so much from its peak of $329 in 2021 to $112 in 2021? $NVDA had a peak of ~$329 in 2021 and dropped 66% to ~$112 last year, presumably in part due to the rising interest rates. However, it's now recovered to almost $290 which is near its peak. What happened in the past 2 years for this massive up and down? Covid and crypto increased the sales and profit margin. It started falling after crypto crash and lower chip/card sales. US banned high powered chips to china which crushed it to 130. chatgpt and AI news lead to short covering and more buying and it is 288 now. Thanks for the comprehensive response Thanks. It?셲 hard to come by an actually good response First gaming, then crypto and now AI - this too shall pass NVDA is perfect example of bubble price action you guys should see the historical prices. NVDA has always been a trader's wet dream. During and after dotcom, it went up 300% a few times, then imploded 90% a few times. Seems like everyone's forgotten the failed Arm acquisition.

2023-05-18,"Hanams Yahas oxen   Jesus atonements death Lets burn up today Is there potential to short NVDA?  NVDA is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow . The company is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year . NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years . I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning. I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels. Seems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think? Update: I did see the +20% move after NVDA reported earnings. Luckily I did not open the short position yet. However, after briefly reading the filings I believe this could potentially be an even better short as valuation is more ridiculous It makes sense to short??so you shouldn?셳 short it. Everyone has lost their minds. probably better to sell way out of the money credit call spreads if you want to bet on NVDA pullback. Ya everything tech feels overbought and this AI craze just isn?셳 passing my smell test, but you can?셳 fight the current and survive. The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. Yep. Someone like gates can hold his half bill Tesla short till it?셲 profitable or he just decides to cut his losses - capital isn?셳 the issue of maintaining the position. For us, trying to wait it out is as you described Don?셳 try it. You?셪l just lose money. The market is fucking irrational and I?셶e gotten fucked shorting it. Don?셳 do it till it starts dropping by itself. No point entering while it?셲 grinding up. It?셲 so overvalued that if it is going to come down, there?셲 a long way to go down and a lot of time to get in The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning. Let that sink in for a moment. I wouldn't personally short the stock, but I surely am not going to go long either just because ""earnings will 1000x over the next years thanks to demand from ai-related stuff"" An AI trading bot that has about an 85% success rate , told me to short NVDA yesterday at $310, about 20 minutes later it closed its contract because it passed its stop loss. Not even the AI can short the AI.  I have lost so much shorting NVDA over the last few months . A correction is clearly coming, but guessing when it will happen is a crap shoot . At this point they are basically a meme stock . Lets go take a look I have SOXX and Samsung ElectronicsIt doesnt go up as much as micron but Im happy that it went up Why NVDA keeps going up? WTF is going on with NVDA? It keeps going up and it doesnt seem like it will stop anytime soon. I read some comments in about a couple weeks ago that many people are shorting @320 but it seems a pretty bad idea based on its trend lately. What?셲 your thought? Nvidia is insane. If you had Nvidia?셲 market cap in cash, you could buy all of AMD, all of Intel, and all of TSMC and still have 30 billion left over. If that?셲 not madness I don?셳 know what is. Hey SkyNet, where should I invest all my money? ?쏮e??Say no more fam! /s That applies to my Pypl I just bought some puts so it'll probably go up more edit: it's so nice to be wrong AI is driving it but it's hilarious how low the AI related revenue projections are for some of the semiconductors. Someone posted on here that AMD is projected to get up to $1B in revenue from AI. That's it. And that was the high end. I am staying away because it's really not clear how the AI industry will translate to profits. I have no idea but as someone who bought at $220 I'm just eating popcorn and watching the show. I bought at $220 too. I bought puts at $220 im eating glue As someone who bought at 303 I'm just marveling at seeing it go green again. Didn't think that would happen any time soon.",0

That's a year's salary you got there ?삂 As a highly regarded INTC investor, I approve this message! Well you know how it ends for her. Violently. Nvidia started 30 years ago, Jayne died at 34 Why did Intel go down? Nvida, AMD, and Taiwan Semiconductor went up today. Intel needs to say Ai more during its next earnings report and make an unrealistic projection involving Ai  NVDA confirmed it ate INTC's lunch already, and is currently raiding the fridge . Jensen is saying there?셲 $1T of datacenter CPUs is coming to replace a lot of that processing with GPUs . Boobies.. That mild nip slip though ?쁻 ?? that's where it's at. Generative AI. Intel is now 90% of my $100 portfolio! As an INTC investor, I am looking the curve of NVDA in that way. A mix of jealousy and contempt. Intel drops the bomb on Nvidia and AMD by lowering prices on the A750 to just $199.  AMD panic lowers MSRP just a day before launch and Nvidia shrugs it off completely due to their AI earnings . Intel already has a great value budget card with comparable performance to the RX7600, slashes its price to just $199, beating AMD's equivalent card by $70, or 26% . At this point, until AMD lowers  When Intel drops Battlemage, there's going to be a price war and that will only benefit consumers . Intel has publicly stated their intention is to undercut the competition to gain market share . AMD should have been doing all along . We need the competition now more than ever . Who's ready for Battlemage and hopefully the return of sane GPU prices? This 3rd player in the GPU market is what we've needed for years. Now to get the 397th player in the video game market to fix that one too! Might have to pick one up for my wife. Her 1080 seems to be dying and an A750 or A770 would be more than enough for her. Can confirm the A750 is extremely good for its price I dunno why having an amd CPU and Intel gpu seems like unholy hilarious Next: AmazonBasics GPU Holding out for a Kirkland GPU. Heck I want to buy one just to own one and vote with my wallet. Please let Intel???foray into GPUs be a thing that endures Me too. Many times I considered buying a A770 16GB just to get me by until Battlemage. But it isn't such a substantial upgrade as to justify $350 for something I'm going to replace in 6-9 months. Nvidia rush orders lifting TSMC 5nm fab utilization So the economic downturn had left TSMC with plenty of unused capacity at 6 and 7, and 4 and 5 are only approaching full utilization. There has been no need to decide between consumer products or professional ones like some keep saying. NVIDIA's gaming revenue is higher than it was pre pandemic. They are selling plenty of RTX cards. During the pandemic the cards were made by Samsung.  AMD found out with 1080 Ti vs 20-series - cutting too far leads to future problems down the road . Smooth generational iteration is better than revenue today from hyperdealz followed by what feels like a large bump with next generation .  Even $500 is probably a much lower margin than NVIDIA would like, if $500 doesn't produce a large increase in sales it's certainly not worth going deeper this early in the product cycle . Remember, they have to fund the development of the next generations out of that too, it's not just BOM cost .  EVGA decided to leave on a high note after the massive 10x profit of the mining years . Demand was obviously going to suck for a while after mining finally slumped off . It's better to just move their wafers to enterprise for a couple years and wait it out .  NVIDIA is losing money on every sale but making it up in volume is a meme not a real business strategy . ""Losing money"" here is any number below what they need to fund the next generation of hardware . If gaming was doing great then they'd just order more wafers from TSMC .  People think Ampere and Turing were too expensive and actually they were cheaper than they should have been . That's a problem of mis-calibrated consumer expectations . Ada is snapping back to the real price curve, it feels way way too expensive .  4070 reaching $600 is about right on the price curve compared to the previous 2 leading node products - GTX 670 at $399 and GTX 1070 at $429 FE MSRP . $500 for 3070 was fair (3060 Ti for $400 was supposed to be the deal and was incredibly good to the extent partners didn't like it .  AMD over-cut on 6600/6700 family, now 7600 looks like shit in comparison . People were expecting it to blow away an already-great price on 6000 series and of course it didn't . HUB kicking up a fuss on 8GB has forced them to lower that model deeply to get underneath NVIDIA and the 4060 8  The 4060 ti at $400, which is truly DOA without major adjustment, but everyone kinda knows it? Not gonna do as well when the 4060 is available at $300, it needs to fall fifty bucks or so to make up for DLSS/etc . It?셲 like 1080 Ti vs 2070??they overcut on the old thing and the new thing not only doesn?셳 blow it away, it?셲 actually worse in some respects. Oops.  There is no current part that gets to $50 MSRP, no matter how crippled and shitty, because it?Â�� not something you can make a margin on . Products that don?Â� make margin, don?�� get generational upgrades . 6500XT is already the smallest RDNA3 die, on a weird 6nm  The deep sale today is great, but then you need to cut deeper next year . Video games have gone through the same thing, steam sales from the 2010s were too deep and companies have backed away from it because training consumers that if they wait a year or two they get the AAA game at $7.49 isn't good for overall revenue Even Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has admitted that Nvidia is in a strong position to capture the AI opportunities. Where is Intel? Isn't Falcon Shores planned in 2025 after the AI boom is busted? Isn't Falcon Shores planned in 2025 after the AI boom is busted? Haha. Where is Intel? Currently busy shooting itself in the foot in graphics/AI. Though to think this is a passing fab like crypto is naivety. NVIDIA is using AI to print money. TSMC is hopping on the gravy train too. as they say, ""during a gold rush, sell shovels"" Is nvidia planning a more modern update to the Tegra found in their Shield TV products? No.There's no consumer Tegra anymore and the chip Nintendo Next Generation Hardware will use is entirely custom and thus probably only can be used by them. This is just Nvidia's response to corporates buying up their data center stock. If I remember correctly, Huang has been stockpiling chips in anticipation of their orders for the past year or so. They keep a lot of inventory on hand to fulfill corporate orders, and those have only increased recently with the AI craze.",0

LOL. anybody wants this to go down? send me $380 and as soon I press the buy button watch it dump to $250. The last time they announced this/ literally nothing happened. Uhhh 10b when the market cap is 963b And the revenue is 6b Broadcom on Thursday I came in right after selling it at Nvidias highest price and going up around 3 but its a good timing lol Hello No1 NVIDIAIll eat twice as much and organize itwith the money as it isI transferred to Broadcom for second place
Im looking forward to it twice as much I just got off work from the company While drinking coffee watching the 7 letters of Broadcom with a happy heartWhy do you feel so goodA new paradigm called ai was created by ShingoLets get over the vmware hurdle well TSMC N3, And Challenges Ahead What stood out to me is that N3E, which will probably be used in both rdna4 and Blackwell, is expected to yield a 34% reduction in power consumption (at the same speed and complexity) or an 18% performance improvement (at the same power and complexity) I hope this is the generation where they have to actually compete and we see the benefits of chiplet technology in GPUs.  The gains per shrink are now getting worse, while the price keeps climbing . I'm kind of doubting the next generation, in name at least (RX 8000 and RTX 5000), is actually going to use N3E . Maybe RDNA4 and Blackwell will, but I wonder if that generation isn't an entire refresh away . RTX 4080 renamed to RTX 5070 with a price drop to like $700, 7900xtx > 8800xt for the same $700. RX 7600 refreshed to 8500xt for $199 etc. I mean if N3E is 30% faster than 5nm, and costs 30% more per wafer, where is the gain? Maybe do 1 product for each brand to slot above the old performance kings. Replace the 4090 with a 600mm2 N3E GPU that pulls 500w, and charge people $2500 as the 5090, but I hardly see a point in engineering a whole new line up if they have this much room to eventually drop prices on the current gen. It will depend on the variant, the closest one to 30% energy reduction only brings a 11% perf increase over N5. One thing you need to remember is those numbers are always given on some standard structure. With performance they mean clock speed. That won?셳 directly translate to end products. They will use the increased transistor density to fit more complex systems on the chip and performance gain to power consumption probably is not linear. And another thing is sram because there is more and more sram on chips and that doesn?셳 seem to improve from N5. Next generation is almost certainly based on N4X if released next year. N3E won't make it into HPC until late 2025. Will Intel use this for Arrow Lake? Nopes, Intel will use its own 18 process If I remember correctly, they're using it for one of the dies. They're dual-sourcing the compute die IIRC. Something like Mobile is N3B or N3E, while Desktop is 20A. Not saying that's exactly what it is, but something to that effect. Nobody really knows what TSMC N3 generation (Blackwell, Zen5 etc) will be. No chips taped out. TSMC teased 15% performance, OR 25% power saving AND/OR 60-70% logic scaling. SRAM scaling is bad. So more SP, and better RT hardware. nVidia N4 (5nm) yields good enough to sell 7680/7680 SP (CUDA) 4070ti. If N3 similar, then they will aim for bigger chips. What has nVidia done before? chip sizes xx90 +50% SP xx80 +33% SP xx070. ie the 2080ti was +50% of 2080. 4090 broke this rule.. it was +80%. What would +60% SP look like? 4090 -> 5090 100SM, 25600 SP << very unlikely, because would push power >600W. about 21,000 SP more likely. 4080 -> 5080 60SM, 15360 SP << almost 4090 level! 4070 -> 5070 38SM, 9728 SP << 5070 would match 4080, like 4070 matches 3080.",6

Imma sitting on 15% gains on it and I believe it'll get to 50 in the next year.
But that's just like... my opinion man... Companies like Nvidia are over hyped and 1 hiccup it could drop like a stone, Companies like intc are pricing in disaster for a long time,and if any uptick in prospects happens the price could Lurch upwards fast. It could rain in two weeks, but it could also be sunny. The wind may blow, but it may also sit still. If the clouds come in, everything may be fine. So don?셳 use Reddit but instead use YouTubers as a source for financial advice got it. I personally like INTC as it is back by Gov and currently in the process of building a $20 billion fabrication site in Ohio. Everyone has to make their own decisions, but I'm very bullish on INTC for the following reason: Pat is in charge and he is a very details, data driven person who has already shaken up management Global situation is in their favour. (Not just in Taiwan, CHIPS act, etc). Look at insider buying. The INTC insiders are buying a lot of their own stock. Actually have made inroads in graphics (new the new ARC cards) Is going to try the foundry route. Your time frame is 5-10 years. Most of the steps above will lead to improvements, but will be a few years to get there. I imagine that most people will just avoid INTC for the next few years as it will be dead in the water till it starts showing improvement. Then everyone will pile back, but you might miss some of the rebound. No way. It?셲 at a good price now. I am actually hoping for steady gains and I have some limit buys ready for any dips. I think it?셲 a good company and not a bad investment Not financial advice. I would not only hold my position. I would be DCAing down the overall cost to something closer to today's price so I was profitable again sooner. I actually do have INTC bookmarked as a ""buy soon"" and I will be doing that. I will take all of the shares of INTC anyone wants to send my way, purchase me, or donate towards me purchasing. I am certain they are only down, and FAR from out. I've been considering a position in Intel for quite a while. If their FAB play works out and they can start producing high end chips on a large scale there is a whole lot of upside. I think that is quite a ways out, so I am not rushing in, but I think the companies worst is behind them. Its so tasty hehe No matter where Im left or not Im the only one who makes money Like this This is pretty Im going to die I feel goodLets go beyond 1000 daughters Surging in a short period of time I think there are people who think that well be able to adjust the periodThe stock in the paradigm of the new industry called AI is not a swing responseThe strategy of continuing to sell every little drug adjustment is based on the rate of return and salesHigher Seeds Lead to Higher ProfitMaximizing StrategiesIf you found out about this stock 2 years ago and became a holder youre lucky If you sell this stock now This is too scary The performance will be announced around dawn tomorrow in Korean time right

2023-05-31,"$INTC is a very undervalued AI play.  Intel is a great value at its current price and a hidden gem in plain sight as NVDA gets the spotlight . I think its ultimately going to come down to INTC/NVDA vs AMD vs AMD . Time to hype this chip maker ?삄...with the magic words... Just because INTC started making some gaming GPUs doesn?셳 mean they will seriously compete with NVDA in AI lol Private enterprise cannot live on handout from taxpayers forever. Disagree. On the compute side, no one is using intel based processors for ML workloads. AMD is cheaper, and far cheaper still are ASICs, ARM-based processors, and so much of the ML community relies on cuda through NVIDIA GPUs. On the manufacturing side, intel fabs are several lithography generations behind TSMC. Intel itself uses TSMC for the latest generation processors because their fabs are behind. Investing in new fab tech is always a multi-year gamble ahead and we haven?셳 seen the customer base or the steep investment in new cutting edge fab techniques. What intel has going for it is xenophobic gov buyers who want American vertical integration, even if it means semiconductors are less efficient or several generations behind the state of the art. As of now, Intel and TSMC densities are at parity for HP cells (when comparing TSMC N3 against Intel 4 nodes). They no longer have process technology leadership. By next year TSMC will be more than a year behind. The silver lining for TSMC is their capacity, ecosystem and PDK will keep them as the number one foundry for the foreseeable future. They also will retain a lead in specific segments like ultra low power mobile since their HD cells have excellent characteristics at ISO density compared to Intel. Xenophobia? Ideally, we should be using products manufactured in our home country. Doing that doesn't preclude foreign chips. It is really hard for Intel to compete with TSMC. Simply because ""everything"" is much cheaper to make in asia. Even TSMC says it'll cost them much more to build chips in the USA than their factory in Taiwan. Another example is Tesla cars are much cheaper to make in their shanghai factory than their USA factory. It also puzzled my mind when people says Tesla have such good manufacturing ability when Chinese are building cars at a fraction of the price. The fact that the government wants to use your tax money to invest in Intel should tell you how bad of an investment this is. Just look at GM. Intel can barely make it as it is and now they are signing up to return a chunk of future profits back to the government. It is an awful investment So tell me how INTC plans on gaining competitive advantage in the fab game when they are 10 years behind Samsung which is 3-5 years behind TSMC? People in this sub think they are just ?쐌onths?쓇ehind. Funny how in 2021/2022 it was the 5% great dividend (now cut) and great CEO (overpromising and not delivering) as the reason to buy and now it is the hope for a turnaround when they clearly are miles behind their competitors any stock that anyone needs to try to convince you to buy is exactly the thing you shouldn't buy I worked for Intel and my specialization is in Deep Learning. I would not bet favorably on Intel. The company's leadership is very lethargic and lags significantly in terms of staying up-to-date with the latest advancements let alone getting ahead of the competition. The future is fundamentally unpredictable. So anything is possible. But I wouldn't assign a good probability of Intel reaping some benefit of the AI explosion. Composite man must love seeing posts like these. Intels fate will be same as nokia?쫒 am not willing to bet on them untill they prove me wrong Untrue.

It does not appear in the devices: (lspci) and I installed the package: firmware-iwlwifi Does anyone know how to make it work? thx :) Why do you assume that your Wi-Fi is Intel AX201? lspci shows that your Wi-Fi is Network controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. Device b852 Or do you have a Wi-Fi dongle? In which case you need : lsusb Because I have the same computer on Windows, and I checked the card model :) I think realtek will be cable ;) I don't have the answer to your question, but I have the same wireless card on one of my devices, and it works on a Debian 12 minimal install. Same card here - works on Debian 11 with kernel from backports. I had a similar problem with an ax200 card and it was because I had a windows install on another drive with fast boot enabled, as soon as I disabled fast boot, the wifi worked. Try booting Windows, disable ""Fast Boot"", hit ""Restart"" (not ""Shut Down"") then boot back into Debian  I don't know if it's a bug or a misconfiguration on Gnome / Debian 12, but I have the exact same card and it was also not recognized - although strangely, WiFi was working . Same card, same issue here . Is your WiFi actually working? The issue was a conflict between NetworkManager and the ifupdown package. Going into /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and changing ""managed=false"" to ""true"", removing ifupdown and a reboot fixed it for me. EDIT: I didn't notice that you were on 11. It's probably Windows' Fast Startup and/or needing to add non-free and non-free-firmware to your sources.list Try booting from a LiveUSB of a different distro that has wifi firmware included, like Pop OS. Check to see if wifi is detected or you get the same results. You might need to manually load the kernel module for that hardware. If that's the case, then you can set it up to automatically load that particular module on subsequent boots. I used separate image with non-free firmware and testing release. To make it work during installation, so you might need to install firmware-non-free or how it is called, not at computer right now. firmware-non-free firmware-linux-nonfree is already installed :/",2

I accepted Ivey AEO with BMOS but got off the queens commerce waitlist today . I want to pursue high finance or consulting . I like that Queens has a 4 year program. Whereas Ivey only has a 2 year one . I heard that Ivey ranks better in both??idk if that? Agree with post below. Decide how much you think you can maintain the 80 plus extras and if that provides 2 years of stress vs. a direct entry program. You are not in Ivey and if for whatever reason you don't meet the conditions will you regret not choosing Queens? What's your average? Still on waiting list for Queens commerce there's no job from ivey you can't get at queens. if you like queens go to queens!  The 2+2 program has given me the opportunity to make many more interesting friends and take a wider breadth of classes . In the short term, this means that I'm way more engaged at uni and I assume in the long term when I start the HBA program I will be surrounded by a more intellectually diverse set of people which I really Some of my peers don't like this though mainly because you have to maintain your average to keep AEO which is quite a bit of pressure and they don't have interests outside of business. If you relate to this, Queens might be the better choice. I would suggest sticking with Ivey. It may be only 2 years but employment stats for Ivey are miles better than for Queens. They've got finance firms that exclusively recruit from Ivey as well.  I'd only suggest switching to QComm if you don't think you could keep an 80 average while doing ECs . If you can't afford their tuition or if there's some other reason you'd prefer QComm than Ivey like if Queens is closer so you can commute and you'd be really scared about moving out . Definitely don't switch because you think it'd be better for career prospects. average base salary for the queens link you sent uses 2018 figure and the difference is mainly due to the larger amount of people that choose to go into finance or consulting at ivey https://smith.queensu.ca/_templates/documents/bcom/CAC-BCom2022-employment-report.pdf I've been corrected by this comment. The Queens stats were out of date. Last year, the average salaries for Queens surpassed Ivey with the averages for Queens being $86k in the financial services industry and Ivey's being $81k.  If you have a company you'd really like to work for, check the recruiters they list in the links I sent you and see if any recruit from only one of the schools . As for exclusive firms that only hire from Ivey, I'd be surprised if that wasn't also the case for Queen's .  Ivey had higher pay than QComm in finance for the past 5 years . This just changed this year . This could mean QComm is overtaking Ivey or it could be a one off thing . Regardless these are two incredible schools where you'll be able to succeed in the industry either way . So how I see it is this. If salary is the most important factor to you and you're worried that Queen's making more than Ivey grads this year was a one off thing then maybe go for Ivey.  In my personal opinion, I think this trend with Queen's making more than Ivey grads will be a long term thing . With Queen's you don't have to worry as much about your ECs and keeping an 80% average . Otherwise unless you like Western better because it's cheaper, closer, has a better vibe etc. I'd Did you able to see the offer on OUAC to change your acceptance?

Market Insider a securities magazine cited the BlackRock report on the 1st saying After removing the illusion of largescale technology stocks from the SP 500 index of the US stock market the bare face of the US economic contraction has already been revealed The US stock market is already on the decline due to the economic downturn but investors are not properly grasping this situation

The reason why the PCE price index is drawing attention is that the stock market fluctuated as the Consumer Price Index CPI released on the 14th came out higher than expected If the PCE price index which is based on the US Federal Reserve Fed also exceeds expectations the possibility of a rate cut originally expected will be lowered

2023-06-05,"Could this really be There are no angels who bought more than 800 dollars right If you got dragged in here Water it a lot Peter Zeihan is not a serious intellectual Hope this post doesn't break any rules... I don't think everything Peter Zeihan says is wrong, but I dismiss him as any sort of a serious geopolitical intellectual for the following reasons: His main theory that he bases his career off of is that global trade and order will immediately break down once the United States stops protecting the world's oceans, as if other countries are too stupid/inept to work together to preserve their own prosperity and security... ??which is a silly scenario to even consider in the first place, because the greatest beneficiary of global trade won't suddenly stop protecting it when the cost-benefit analysis of doing so is strongly in America's favor and all-powerful American corporations would overwhelmingly oppose its breakdown.  American dependence on foreign goods has only GROWN since launching its trade disputes with the rest of the world several years ago . It is far easier for America and better for the American consumer to have the USN continue patrolling a few sea lanes than further exacerbate inflation and waste taxpayer money reshoring everything . He moronically claims that the two main determinants of a country's future are geography and demographics, leading him to promote economic/social/political basket cases as the next regional hegemons, while claiming perfectly functional countries to be on verge of dramatic change if not outright collapse.  Zeihan is a strong proponent of the ""China will collapse in 30 seconds"" theory . He has written articles on China's soon-to-come economic collapse at least as far back as 2010 and predicts it every year since . He gets really basic facts and figures wrong all the time on his videos and presentations. These mistakes are usually not completely detrimental to his arguments, but they certainly make him look unprofessional.  There is a CCP/PRC apologist YouTuber named Nathan Rich who made a few videos exposing a few presentations Zeihan gave on China . You can watch them for yourselves . What do you guys think about Zeihan? I think some of his work (like his maps) are useful, and he is capable of making sense of a situation after its occurrence in an entertaining way, but I don't think he should be trusted at all to predict major trends. But you have to admit, there's a bit of money to be made by telling people what they want to hear, that goes double if you have a nice soothing voice. If you want to know how credible he is, he's basically the intellectual father of r/geopolitics Man that sub used to be really good back when it was very small, then it became r/worldnews 2.0. Joffre class carrier He said that the US would produce the most oil in the world (correct) by 2020 and this would enable the US to dominate energy markets, rendering the traditional oil producers obsolete (not correct). That was what I mostly remember about him when he first appeared ~2014. That prediction seemed hilariously wrong even at the time and what cemented his clown status for me was the fact that he was a protege of George Friedman, who also had a bunch of clownish predictions. I wonder if anyone based their investment portfolio on Zeihan hahaha... Since nobody here is asking this, I will. Compared to Zeihan, who is a relevant serious intellectual with actually interesting and daring takes? Any recommendations? He is a book seller who caters to american audience. As long as he gets $$$ he will make any type of prediction Peter Zeihan makes Minnie chan look like u/plarealtalk  US, realizing there were only enough resources to transition the US to green energy, would literally go to war with the ???est of the world??(his words) to claim those resources for itself . Then someone asked him the question about why the US, if they realized there weren?셳 enough resources like lithium, etc to make every country?셲 power grid green, go to war just to transition their own despite the fact that it wouldn?셳 help with climate change in any meaningful manner (since no one else could transition) Zeihan reply was essentially that a sort of wishy washy answer that American politics can get pretty insane and that anything could happen. The guy is a hack. I?셝 say he?셲 a moron but the truth is he?셲 smart enough to sell to the morons what they want to hear. You shouldn't trust anyone who claims to be an expert on everything. I.e. Mr. ""I am a generalist"". But Zeihan and Chang deserve our respect, because at least they made predictions that could be proven/disproven within a reasonable amount of time. It'd be so much easier to make some vague prediction (the market's going to crash!) without a timeline and then ignore it if it doesn't happen or make excuses about how it's still totally going to happen. Nevertheless, I don't think Zeihan and Chang are honest enough to confront their own predictions that haven't panned out and critically analyze why their predictions were wrong, at least I haven't seen any videos or articles of it, maybe someone else has and can provide us with a link. The important thing about predictions is that they need to be given a probability of happening, otherwise we can't mathematically show how accurate someone is. If you say ""the market's going to go down"" do we give you an accuracy of 0 if it doesn't happen and 100 if it does? What if you make an additional prediction of ""the market's not going to go down""? Do you have an accuracy of always 50 now? If you say ""the markets going to go down"" (the S&P500 index will be significantly lower >5%, this is 90% likely to happen within 3 years, then we can compare all the predictions you said were going to happen at 90% and see if it's actually close to 90% accurate. (given enough predictions).  Another important part of predictions is explaining why you think something's going to happen . You need to explain the mechanism of action behind a phenomenon . If you say, this ball is going to fall to the ground in 0.62s because of the law of gravity, we can follow your reasoning .  If you just say, well, I don't know how it works, but this ball is going to hit the ground in 0.62s, you're just guessing, even if you're right . Imagine a thousand monkeys typing on a MacBook Pro in a Starbucks making predictions about the future of the world order . One of them will be correct The same applies to human ""experts"", except they don't have to roll the dice as much because humans can make more educated guesses, but guesses nonetheless. This is why Zeihan has his ""demographics is destiny"" and Meowsheimer has his ""anarchic world order"". Most of Zeihan's ideas aren't ""new"", they come all the way from his time at Stratfor with Friedman. You can see this in the book ""The Next 100 Years"" and interviews when he was still VP? at Stratfor. Zeihan also isn't a great military expert, (in my opinion), even if he's an expert on ""geopolitics"".  He buys arguments such as ""Taiwan has been preparing for 60 69 70 80 years for an invasion, PLA has no experience"" and ""PLA has no one who has seen real combat"" (this one is technically false, but nevertheless true for most of the PLA, because there is at least one General in active service who saw combat during the  He seems to have a blind spot for the massive Chinese military build up over the past 30 years and seems to think Chinese Navy doesn't have ships can't protect its trade routes if the US stops for whatever read . China is building up a massive blue water navy including super carriers . And as you say, his take on Taiwan having 80years to prepare for invasion therefore China has no chance is stupid. It doesn?셳 appear Taiwan have done a whole lot of serious preparation in the past 20 years or so until fairly recently, meanwhile China sure as hell has spent that time preparing well for an invasion. I see Zeihan a great example of what not to look for in an expert. I'm fairly familiar with the kinds of awful takes he likes to spout on China, and for that matter he sits in the same circus as Gordon Chang, just somehow even less entertaining. Yes I believe Zeihan himself is just another CIA asset on youtube just like that Harris dude. Directly or indirectly funded they follow a narrative agenda that is US centrist about politics and worldview, so they should be exposed as such. But whatever, this is the new ""normal"". What people should be worried about is how Zeihan talks make to their YouTube front page instead of all the other thousands of scholars talking about the same topics. It is almost like Zeihan videos should come with a ""sponsored"" tag but to hell with that. What I DO wanna talk about is how OP had to post this: I myself am not pro-CCP/China at all Reddit is becoming such a cesspool that everytime anyone says ANYTHING where they are not beating China/Russia, they (me included) have to include these lines disclosing no CCP/Putin/Commie/whatever ties because otherwise Reddit downvotes and call people names. COUNTLESS TIMES I myself have been called ""russian troll"" on this site, hostile af if you ask me but I'm still here.  Reddit was always a circlejerk, ok, anyone disagreeing of a post ""vibe"" was downvoted to hell . Real conversations only take place when you sort comments by controversial, but this is basic education . We don't treat people bad because we don't agree with them, we call people ""[country] shill"" because I will talk China, Russia, America and whatever else I want, I will put no disclosures, downvote me all you want, but can we all please just go back to basic education? Please reddit, stop calling people China/Russian assets, have some sportsmanship would ya? Even this term ""CCP"" is wrong. DEAD wrong. The correct name is CPC. But no sir, we don't respect anything Chinese here, America IS the greatest country in the world, doesn't matter the Chinese have a 5k year history, our Country in just 300 years is much better in ANY aspect! [shoots ceiling] Reddit is becoming such a cesspool that everytime anyone says ANYTHING where they are not beating China/Russia, they (me included) have to include these lines disclosing no CCP/Putin/Commie/whatever ties because otherwise Reddit downvotes and call people names. COUNTLESS TIMES I myself have been called ""russian troll"" on this site, hostile af if you ask me but I'm still here. Sheesh. This part got me to feel. I would always get called comrade whenever I speak in favor of a Russian/Soviet achievement, even if it's 1000% undoubtedly correct. It's borderline insanity at this point, and even further amplified by the shithole that is NCD.  Every time he says that china has a blue water navy and cant project power any further than 10 miles off its coast I just shake my head . That was true a few decades ago, but today china is probably the 2nd most powerful navy on earth with 3 aircraft carriers and the most powerful destroyers on earth type 055 . Peter Zeihan is a religious fanatic, a noted liar, and a complete weirdo. The works of his I have read through are light on sources, full of speculation, and almost entirely rides on emotive and charged vocabulary to construe banal observations into evidence of some horrific caricature that is only believed in the west because of its political expediency.

TSMC leaving Taiwan so China has nothing else to foam at the mouth over....China desperately wants Taiwan's chip production capabilities because China can barely manufacture chips to run a clock radio ?ㄳ China literally has a market to dismantle technology so they can repurpose the chips in it  China is not going to give up on Taiwan . TSMC would reduce western dependence on Taiwan and rewrite the current calculus of ?쐗e must defend Taiwan??to ?äääe could live without them??  Taiwan is, more than anything else, a symbolic thing for China . They will attempt reunification before them current Chinese parties??100 year anniversary . If they invaded Taiwan today it would have the added benefit of threatening the semiconductor market sure, but that would impact China too . Yay bring more people to an already over populated city. I'm so glad we are sinking money into this instead of helping the homeless situation we have, the health care and treatment for the mentally ill and addicted individuals, and fixing our broken roads and shitty infrastructure! We sure allocate funds well! While more jobs is generally uplifting news, there was another article posted not long ago on some of the more popular subreddits that discussed how TSMC is having massive issues getting anyone to want to work for them in the US, given their culture and working conditions, as well as a mandatory 12 to 18 month overseas training period. Wow, I don't know much about semiconductor chips but talk about a hot industry! Then there's the one in Sherman, TX.",0
2023-06-08," TSMC negatively rated on HR site glassdoor . Only 27% of people would recommend TSMC to a friend . The average American may not realize that TSMC is a labor-intensive foundry and they only produce semiconductors. Most of the profits from semiconductors profits are in the hands of companies like Intel, AMD, Qualcomm and Texas Instruments. Due to the world's currency properties and the financial industry, the value of the U.S. currency is inflated, which results in the world's top manufacturing profits still not meeting the payroll and labor needs of Americans (TSMC, the world's top manufacturing industry, still has a far lower net profit margin than the financial industry). With Americans crying every day for manufacturing to come back, I am curious if an American citizen can really stay for a week if they are asked to work in a factory that makes clothes and socks. There are plenty of Westerners who will gladly take the pay and put in the time on shifts. TSMC works because it has Asian style management. Engineers are practically used as technicians in tsmc. They just operate the processes and are required to be responsible for the very batch you produce from end to end. Something went a bit wrong or there is not enough capacity for an order you are part of? Time to pull another all nighter at the plant. That is where the problem starts for tsmc at Arizona. American employees dun follow the rule of seeing your through till the end and Taiwanese engineers have to pick up all the slack. The whole thing is going to come apart at the seam. Can end product manufacturers sell their product at extra inflated prices so that they can pay tsmc properly? The only thing that held customers back from moving away is tsmc efficiency and ability to produce cutting edge processor chips at high quality rate while keeping duds to a minimum. With Americans crying every day for manufacturing to come back  A market is just a meeting of individuals. One individual accepts the terms of another individual, both on equal footing . There are no other forces at work here. All of the outcomes of history rest on their individual decisions solely . Taiwanese biz don't exactly have a good rep in China too, beside Wang Wang TSMC: you think all those record-volume Qualcomm and Apple chips just wake up and etch themselves?? *cracks whip Problem for Americans is that getting cancer from producing microstructures must be paid out of pocket Chairman: Don't come if you're not willing to work the shift Also Chairman: The shift is 24/7, all emails and texts are expected to be answered within 10 mins regardless of time, but we only pay you for 8 hrs a day because you'll be salaried...wahaha. With WFH attitude, this will get a lot worse. TSMC will be bleeding money in the US. Let see if Uncle Sam is willing to do much to help. Intel is getting into foundry business, so the US will balance which one to support: the Chinese one (TSMC) or American one. didn't some other asian semi company tried to open fabs in u.s before and they only had like 55% yeild instead of like 97% for the asian one and had to close after a short time can't recall who it was. also american working there are going to do all they can to get to be the boss because they can't stand working for asians and pretty sure they will run the place to the ground. And we will see how fast American love will disappear once they actually have to deal with Taiwanese and the way they do things. Just like Foxconn.. Americans are more than welcome to work and stay in their dormitories with suicide-nets Not enough people truly understand what it takes to mass fabricate high technology on a continuous production line.

TSMC Exec Tells U.S. Workers to Expect Long Hours or Go Home I?셫 sure the Taiwan way of working will fit just in to the American way. People actually have a life besides a stupid job. Good luck with that filling the spots after the first batch of people have quit their positions due to this kind of BS. There are American jobs that demand as much as TSMC demands. They just pay a lot better. If you pay them, they will come. ""Those who are unwilling to take shifts should not enter the industry, since this field isn't just about lucrative wages but rather a passion for [the semiconductor industry],"" Liu said. Every ceo saying crap like it can go stuff it. If it's about passion and not only lucrative wages he can passionately use his own salary to hire more people and offload some work from overworked staff. US tech workers are willing to work long hours but also expect high compensation. I don't know if this strategy is going to work. ""Passion for the industry"" does not mean working your fingers bloody to make someone else rich Oh, I guess their prices are also not about profit then, right ? Another rich guy high off his own farts Another insane suit out to prey on people's enthusiasm to the point of stripping their passion for life. I fucking hate people like him. (Pardon my language.) TSMC opens new multi billion dollar facility state side and demands workers grind themselves up on the gears DAY 1 workers: So hey, we know you wanted us to work 16 hour shifts but we have decided to join this thing called a Union...so yeah...8 hours it is. Thx What I don?셳 think Mr Liu understands is that semiconductors a) does not confer social cachet in the U.S. and b) workers can pivot to industries with better working conditions. I think his problem is mostly with a) because unlike in Asia, STEM jobs here are considered for nerds who lack the extraversion for more lucrative management and finance jobs.  TSMC has been letting on that workers in the USA are too dumb, lazy, and overpaid for a long time . Simple guess as to why: Taiwan depends on the US for its security . If anybody can do the work just as well, what would make Taiwan worth western protection?  Morris Chang has been making similar statements for a while now, and apparently their existing Arizona footprint left a very bad impression on him . Chang: ""I think you're adding a political angle to a much fundamental problem. They genuinely believe that US workers are too dumb, lazy, and overpaid"" Yeah because that worked so well for Elon when he bought Twitter ?ㄳ Semi-Con foundaries are slave drivers. period. Simple supply and demand will tame working expectations over time in an aggressive company like TSMC. American work ethic is different, and the Taiwanese leadership is too naive to realize that. This will eventually work itself out.

PE ~200 AI = 42069 My guy, Goodyear tires at 500+ PE and who gives a crap Over inflated tires 1 trillion market cap sounds cool. but you know what sounds cooler?!? 2 trillion!!!! calls all the way!!!!! TSLAs PE got to 1396 at peak =) That's peak regard right der Soooooo.....more weekly calls. Got it. ?????????????????????뙔 Great comment. The lack of rockets recently in this sub has been quite concerning. You are on to something here mate. You should totally buy puts. this is what happens when the Fed floods the market with cash for a decade plus. NVDA is the king. How dare you put a value on the king based on some P/E? It?셲 ironic that AI will cause the next Tech Wreck. Post the calculation for the PE here so you might learn something. My calculation is typing in nvidia stock in google and reading the PE number I love these posts lmfao!! I will keep laughing my ass off all the way to $500. To all of those who have invested and kept your Diamond hands, congrats you have reached an upper echelon of the future :) What in the Wall Street bets kind of post is this? What diamond hands? You wouldn?셳 need diamonds hands if you just did your research.. Who are you congratulating? The people who hopped on the stock cause they saw it going up and used that as the only reason to invest in it? I swear this subreddit after WSB discovered the stock ?쁻 Thanks for saying this. This sub has deteriorated the last few weeks and months. Buy the frickin' stock if you believe in it, then STFU please. If you're a day trader or speculator, get on WSB, better sub for you. I love the stock?셲 performance but it has attracted a a lot of WSB degenerates. Eventually will reach $1000 or $1200, in my opinion. Solid company Agree with the sentiments here. But the added attention comes with the territory. This sub has sort of always gotten more animated around earnings. But the number one stock, plus the giant moves, plus the huge earnings beats? You have to expect some of that. And if diamond hands means, holding a volatile investment even when there's pressure to sell I think some of us, no question, have been through that. So take it as a compliment! The 1000 mark will come sooner then you think This too, I feel like it could hit $1000 in one day in theory or 5 years, ofc we don?셳 fully know. Holding 40 shares @ $506 for the future. 1000 soon. Diamond hands? Wtf is that Thank you. Having an amazing 2024. Hope you are too. Congrats to all the longs. Just sold a spread too how much further can it rally after a 44% gain in a month lol We have definitely reached a point of mania. It's start to get more then a little silly. I bought a $500 call expiring March 2024 last September when it was around $400. Sold it at $500 in November and laughed my way to the bank. Now I cry for an hour every night before I fall asleep. Owning LEAPS I feel like the driver. Did you buy my $2.50 650C? Because that's what some asshole paid me for it Turns out your brokerage actually allows you to buy shares in addition to selling options. Pretty neat feature tbh Sha... Air.....?!?! Bruh Why would you sell calls when a stocks price is going ex on your ass? Because eventually it will stop, right? ?쫞ight??? What is your opinion on NVDA? Will it end up like ZM? Monthly charts of ZM and NVDA both looks similar and seem that NVDA has started a downward trend. The correction may take it below 700. I am holding at 831. I think i bought in bull trap. My target sell is 845. Thoughts?? are you genuinely and seriously comparing nvidia and zoom right now The chart is similiar, can?셳 you see it???? Exactly the same Company and fate basically Zoom is a small web company that saw a pandemic boost but has to deal with long term competition from massive market players (Microsoft, slack, Google).  Nvidia is a GPU/CPU maker doing something no one else is doing . If they get caught by competitors, absolute floor is ""oh well we'll just go back to being the biggest graphics processing manufacturer on planet earth"" If they don't, ceiling is ""we're what Intel was in the 90s except this is the biggest computing boon humanity I think apples and oranges is the phrase. While I am a big proponent of chart analysis, the ZM comparison doesn't make sense. The ZM balloon was inflated by COVID where ""stay home"" stocks got to ridiculous valuations on sky high expectations. NVDA is a very different story. They are by far the leader in GPUs and software to leverage those GPUs for machine learning and generative AI. Despite the huge run, their valuation is still reasonable for an elite leader. That said, the chart is troublesome here, it is a screaming short. If the overall market correction continues, NVDA is likely to drop further. If the 750 area is lost, a gap fill to the 675 area is possible. If this should happen, I will be buying. If we should get to the 630 area, it will be a gift from the market gods. This stock is going to 1,000 and beyond at some point, it is just a matter of when.  NVDA is different but the correction seems right on the trajectory because nothing lasts forever . Though it's very early to say for NVDA but if it goes down further then it can be a good buy opportunity . The monthly chart? lol ZM is up around 100% since IPO and NVDA is up 350,000% so just a biiiit different on longer charts. This happens every time the markets act irrational! People see significant drops in their portfolio and the conversation heads into panic mode! This market shift worked out for me as a just did a rollover and on a buying spree! This rhetoric is like 2022 all over again! Plus this is a TQQQ sub! This thread makes me bearish on NVDA. So many simps AI is absolute trash in the practical everyday sense. Amazon had Indian slave labor claiming to be AI and you all soaked it up. NVDA is the poster child of wall street. And where fund flows money grows until blood stains the streets. Probably another Cisco. The price nvda charged for their GPUs won?셳 last forever. There is a limit on the demand for GPU to do training. The hype is cooling down. Got any source showing demand cooling down? Demand for processing power only goes up. this is an industry where three year old tech is considered old. Society is not suddenly going to pivot away from compute. Good comparison. But CSCO in 1996, not in 2000. Hope you got your profits today bud. I existed with marginal profit. OP I work in industry and hopefully can shed some light. I held NVDA and made profit. I also recently got dropped in the recent drop to 7 hundred ranges. I sold because I believed it would go to 600s. I did say it will miss the 200MA and go back up. Yet wasn?셳 confident as the drop was sudden and unexpected. My view was NVDA will go beyond 950+. The AI cap or growth is real as well as a fast trajectory. When you listen to recent earnings companies are spending big now in this. One thing to be mindful of Blackwell hasn?셳 had a cost or forecast yet. So the upside should be there. Why am I not in again? Because if it goes to 950 only at current levels for me it?셲 too risky now just for 5%. Hope that helps. NVDA is a trillion dollar company at the forefront of AI, which is revolutionary. Zoom is video conflict software that is easily replicated by Teams, Google, etc. Compare & Contrast. there are smarter people on wall street bets than you holy shit. you can make an argument that NVDA will be corrected but comparing it to Zoom is actually insane You came to a LETF group, and are comparing a high technology company, with a marine sea shipping company?╈?Out of all the weird/dumb investing posts I?셶e seen recently, this is probably one of the top ones.",0

Under Delaware General Corporation Law, a charter amendment to change number of authorized shares requires stockholder approval . For a publicly held company, the approval process is costly and can take several months .  Delaware case law provides that directors have a duty of care, which requires them to act on an informed basis . Maryland case law requires that the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders prevail over any individual interest of a director .  Delaware GCL permits a corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director . Maryland law protects directors from liability for (1) any breach of the director?셲 duty of loyalty to the  Delaware GCL permits a corporation to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent . A covered person who was or is threatened to be made a party to a derivative action can be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys??fees), actually and reasonably incurred by the covered person, but not judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement .  The primary reason a publicly held company will have for doing a reverse stock split is to remain in compliance with the minimum per share price requirements of the stock exchange on which its shares are listed . Stockholder approval is normally required .  Maryland GCL provides that, unless prohibited by the corporation?셲 charter, the board of directors of a Maryland corporation can amend the charter, without stockholder approval, to achieve a reverse stock split by combining shares at a ratio of not more than ten shares into one share in any 12-month period . Delaware GCL contains no such Delaware has long been the incorporation state of choice for most publicly held companies and companies with aspirations of going public. Yet there are compelling reasons ??ten of them discussed above ??for these companies to consider incorporating or reincorporating in Maryland instead.

Be aware that while many of the more lax incorporation rules in Maryland may be advantageous for a massively diluting company and its officers, this comes at the expense of the shareholders.

2023-06-16,"276% profit on BUD puts, now up 220% on INTC calls  Bought $17 K in puts a few days after boycott began, cashed out for $64 K a couple of weeks ago . $95k was the highest day, but I thought I would keep earning . Still made 47K profit, so not a bad month . Wish I would?셶e also bought Target puts. Since cashing out of bud, I?셫 at $32 K on a $10 k Intel call option. And up $4k on an EVGO call.  A TD Ameritrade rep told me that for one of my $BUD calls, I was the only person who bought that call . I found it surprising that after seeing the gravity of the boycott, with shelves full of bud light, more people hadn?�� predicted the seemingly imminent dip . During the frenzy on regional banks, I didn?셳 want to miss out, so I made a snap bet that the banks would recover. I was wrong, and it cost me. Now I try to avoid making snap decisions. It seems pretty easy to make money on options if you are patient and wait for the right opportunity. TL;DR: I bought $17,000 worth of put options on Anheuser-Busch a few days after the boycott began, and cashed out for $64,000 a couple of weeks later. I didn't post about it at the time because I didn't want to jinx it. patient and wait for the right opportunity - that?셲 the key!! TL/DR!? How become rich? A TD Ameritrade rep told me that for one of my $BUD calls, I was the only person who bought that call. facepalm edit: op got called out for lying and went off the fucking rails. it's even funnier when paired with his other comments in this thread, talking up youtube videos. I wish I could buy a put option on Rob mafia?셲 insights It's easy to make money when you're already rich. Anyone can do it if they have the right mindset and approach. I?셫 not rich, but I?셫 hoping to become it. I put in nearly everything I had, and used all the margin I could. How far out did you buy your options? I see the exp but when you bought them how far out were they and atm or otm at that time? This is all of them. All were OTM to varying degrees. Congrats.

2023-06-20,"4 Tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom.  Generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more . This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms .  Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, discussed AI on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16 . Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism . AI and the US Stock Market In May, NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.  The S&P 500 has ""basically been the S-P 7,"" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023 . This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market ""You Are At The Starting Line Of AI""  NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang stated that we are currently at ""the starting line of AI"" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking . Companies should not be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it . Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, I have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. I included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but I also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today. To select our stocks, I looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds long each of them. 1. Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) On June 13, Keith Bachman at BMO Capital raised his price target on Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) from $96 to $132. The analyst also holds a Market Perform rating on the stock. Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) is an information technology company based in Austin, Texas. The company's products and services address enterprise information technology environments across the world. I saw 67 hedge funds long Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion. TD Cowen's John Blackledge expects Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) to benefit from the current AI boom because its cloud-computing platform can offer it some competitive advantages. First Eagle Investment Management held 20.7 million shares in Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest shareholder in the company. 2. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) is an information technology company offering cybersecurity products and services. It is based in Austin, Texas. There were 72 hedge funds holding stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) at the end of the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.4 billion. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) may be an interesting stock pick to play the AI boom considering the company has recently announced new AI-powered indicators of attack (IoA) models. These models can combat advanced adversary tradecraft by using machine intelligence to stop breaches. Tal Liani at Bank of America holds a Buy rating on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) shares as of June 16. The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $162 to $190. 3. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) was spotted in the portfolios of 91 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4.9 billion. Based in Santa Clara, California, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates globally. Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) shares on June 16 from $97 to $138. The analyst also holds an Overweight rating on the shares.  TD Cowen's John Blackledge has picked Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) as one of his tech stocks to play the AI boom . This June, the company revealed its new AI chip in its race with NVIDIA Corporation . Citadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) at the end of the first quarter, making the fund the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter. 4. Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) is a diversified software and information technology company based in San Jose, California. The company's flagship product is its Creative Cloud, a subscription service offering members access to its creative products. John Blackledge at TD Cowen sees Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) as a smart AI play because the company has begun rolling out new generative-AI content creation tools. An Outperform rating was reiterated on Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) shares on June 16 by Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $475 to $590. A total of 99 hedge funds were long Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $7.3 billion. 4. Apple Inc. ($AAPL) Apple Inc. ($AAPL) may not be the first big tech company that comes to your mind when looking for AI plays, but with the company's new Vision Pro headset, some believe it may be getting involved in the machine learning space more than before. Analysts at Bernstein hold a Market Perform rating and a $175 price target on Apple Inc. ($AAPL) shares as of June 14. Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 131 hedge funds long Apple Inc. ($AAPL). Their total stake value was $165 billion. Holding 915.6 million shares in the company, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in Apple Inc. ($AAPL) at the end of the first quarter. As someone in the industry, Oracle is a slow moving behemoth with no record for innovation. It's always last to the table, eg. Was the slowest moving to cloud after the writing was on the wall. What works for Oracle is its large industry contacts and its safe methods. Eg. databases. I don't see it in any way as an AI leader, just a company that got on board once it saw the writing on the wall. Very strange list. The obvious first two would be Google and then Microsoft. AS companies adopt the LLMs they will take massive resources to run them. They take intense computation and far more than any other everyday, general, application. So this is a huge opportunity for Google and also Microsoft and include Amazon. Google is the best positioned as they have the TPUs and that will allow for larger margins. I do agree on Apple. Everyone will have an agent and I suspect Apple will sell that access to their devices. Probably to Google and maybe Microsoft. Like how Apple ""sells"" access to their devices for search. BTW, I have terrible timing. I had just drank some of my coffee when I saw you listed ORCL and I literally spit it up on my keyboard. So, what do you want to release Today? Is there anything else we should know besides what you posted on reddit? Everything is too confusing. Can't even explain properly. Adobe with its consistent but slower growth (compared to Nvidia like plays) can cross ATH soon. My bet is on it although the valuation is stretched. P/S is currently 10ish on a forward basis. CrowdStrike is trash, ask anyone who has to deal with it gumming up their work laptop PANW is the real deal in cyber security. INTC and TSMC. Every tech company in the world will soon have their own AI chips, but you only have a couple of companies that can make them, maybe three if you include Samsung. Apple has nothing AI worthy. Can't spell Apple without Al. Capital A and lower case L. More like hype. This too will die out You think AI will ""die out""? Here is a comprehensive list of stocks in the AI space. Artificial Intelligence Stocks Am I the only one who noticed there are 5 stocks here and not 4?? Also this post is just generated AI drivel??op you are going to get an F on the essay you are trying to write Intel Invests Almost $40Billion Dollars Into New Facilities in Germany, Poland and Israel  Intel has received approval from the German government for the construction of a chip facility in eastern Germany . The German government will provide subsidies worth $10.9 billion to Intel as part of the agreement . Intel shares have already witnessed a 38% increase this year .  Initially, Intel had planned to build a plant in Magdeburg, eastern German city, but due to economic challenges, the project was postponed . The government had previously promised ?.8 billion in aid for that project . In addition to the German facility, Intel also announced plans for a significant chip manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat, Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared that Intel will invest $25 billion in this advanced facility, which is expected to be operational by 2027. Furthermore, last week, Intel unveiled a $4.6 billion semiconductor assembly and test facility in Poland. TL;DR: Intel is setting up new chip facilities in Germany, Poland and Israel, with the German government providing a ??0 billion subsidy. This is part of Intel's wider plan to reduce its reliance on Asian chip manufacturing. They'd better land some customers for their foundry services, and get a competitive manufacturing process, or they're going to be in big trouble. There's no way they're going to fill that capacity on their own. Lol Intel better hope for a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and hope that the ensuing fighting damages TSMC's facilities, that's what's going to give them the business they need. They have Amazon and qualcomm No worries. When TSMC builds factories in the US Intel will steal all their secrets. Intel is spending money like the highly regarded people on here Intel didn?셳 spend anything. It?셲 all incentives and subsidies. For their German foundry, cost is around 30 billion, and only around 10 billion will be in incentives and subsidies. Intel invests? Are you sure was not the gvt who put the money? If Intel is dieing, nobody told Intel. Intel going for the Holocaust trifecta, the gang meets up again going over the good old days. They?셶e been quiet for a decade. Silence since the 2000s. Let?셲 go Intel! Wdym silence since the 2000s? Invest in silicon ingots instead of building new shit, they should have spent more on improving that shitty CPU technology that get hotter in temperature every year, and their incompetent management, and their sale department too. Sales did a bit better than before. Hey, do you have a source? Please add a link in the post or as a reply to this comment! I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

NVIDIA partner ASML: To the Moon How many giant $10B photolithography machines built by ASML does the world need? Are we doubling the number of semi fabs every year? Or does partnering up with NVDA double or quadruple the value of any company? And how many tens of $Trillions can NVDA be worth to justify a 250X valuation? https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-asml-tsmc-and-synopsys-set-foundation-for-next-generation-chip-manufacturing ASML is going to make bank for years to come. They've got a monopoly on EUV machines, and bleeding edge fab companies are buying them up like WSB buys calls. Not only are they selling tons of 0.33 NA machines, they're soon going to be selling high 0.55 NA machines for years.  ASML has had this monopoly for two decades now and it is priced in . So what is the quantum change going forward? There has always been evolution in the photolith process .  There are only about 10 serious chip makers on the planet . There has been a spike in fab building in the West to de-couple from China . TSMC is basically building a mirror image of its Taiwan production . You're right, I really over bought when I got my 7th one. What was I thinking ?쨺 The world doesn't need any more giant $10B photolithography machines, we already have enough. The value of partnering up with NVDA is that it allows us to quadruple the value of any company. NVDA can be worth tens of trillions of dollars to justify a 250X valuation. The world doesn't need any more giant $10B photolithography machines, we already have enough It doesn't. Every time someone builds a fab, they need EUV machines to fill it with. Intel in particular has been in the news with lots of fabs they're building. They're also not $10 billion a pop -- they're a few hundred million. fyi: op and u/Fun-Organization721 are the same person (edit: and u/jripper1138, below. lolz). op is such a weak pos that he uses an alt account (edit: or 2 alts) to back himself up. what a fucking clown. It?셲 not just selling machines what makes ASML profitable. There is so much potential furure cashflow in software support, maintenance, spare parts, training operating staff etc. It comes with euv machine ASML sales. I am in the semi industry. Old Dominion has had this monopoly for two decades now and it's priced in. Anyone know how ASML stacks up against Lam Research and Applied Materials? These all have profit margins around 20%+ so they all should be pretty safe in an inflationary environment. Great question! In the latest quarter - Net Profitability INTC = -5% AMAT = 24.4% ASML = 28% LAM = 26% NVDA = 18.5%  NVDA has the worst net profitability among them all, because NVDA do not control their manufacturing costs . INTC will always have a cost advantage over NVDA since it controls its own fabs and there is no markup as compared to NVDA, which incorporates the markup in its cost structure . The entire semi industry will grow at roughly the same $400million for one high na EUv scanner for use on just the critical layers. By itself one cannot resolve the fine patterns. This is where things get even more extreme. Computational lithography and other things arerequired using 10s of thousands of cpus as well as increasingly gpus. Multipaterning requires extreme etch tricks. It all ads up well beyond $400m for all associated stuff. Wow Micron skyrocketing Yes",8

2023-06-26,AMD is StarfieldExclusive PC Partner I guarantee no dlss then Its a Bethesda game so it will probably shit the bed if you try to play it at over 60fps anyway so it might not be that much of a deal breaker FSR2 mentioned likely that DLSS etc may not be included It really does not matter which card you have specifically everyone should be mad about proprietary anticonsumer bullshit like this I left console wars to escape this type of bs Great now we have to wait pureDark to implement dlss Instead of having an official dlss support Well Todd said that the game would be a modders paradise Damn you would think Nvidia would lock down one of the years biggest games considering how their 40 series is selling right now This keeps happening because Nvidia has recordhigh marketshare and they dont feel the need to spend money on publisher outreach anymore Just guessing though Well fuck I guess no dlss and no ray tracing I have zero faith it will run well regardless of what side sponsors it The absolute best take because we all know its going to be a disaster on launch and finally be good like 3 months later lol But the issue is that AMDs anti consumer policies will block DLSS which the majority of PC gamers would need to use to get a playable framerate Im guessing this means no DLSS support based on AMDs sponsorship history I am also guessing very minimal RT implementation if any Thats unfortunate TLOU and Uncharted are AMD sponsored and have DLSS Halo Infinite is AMD sponsored and has no upscaling whatsoever Rip get ready for a possibly really really bad fsr implementation like in jedi survivor and no DLSS support at all I watched someones playthrough of Jedi Survivor and saw a lot of FSR artifacts Wow what a shit implementation from the lazy devs I thought before learning that fucking AMD sponsored the game How can they let that happen This is quite the disappointing news Saying FSR2 looks incredible might be Todds biggest lie yet you have to decode the morse code from his eye blinking to reveal his true opinion RIP DLSS XeSS and good RT implementation If people cared about ethics as much as they pretend to care now Nvidia wouldve been long outta business lmao People complaining about AMD blocking DLSS in AMD sponsored games dont care about ethics They care about AMD blocking features on their cards that make the game look better At this point i expect any game that has the AMD Rewards sticker to be completely broken at launch and many month after that The Callisto Protocol Forspoken The last of us 1 and Star Wars Jedi Survivor made a very lasting impression in this regard As a 7800X3D4090 User i will probably be fine with Performance and VRAM without DLSS but anyone with an older Nvdida Card should start to worry I also predict the DLSS mod that will release 12 Days after the games launch will be the fastest and most downloaded mod from Nexusmods ever At this point I expect literally every game to be completely broken at launch and many month after that No DLSD and Xess then  ITT people who know nothing about game development or sponsorship deals speculating about both Sponsors have far less power than you think These deals are relatively competitive meaning there were bids from intel and nvidia as well It also means that the IHVs cant make outrageous demands including anything that affects the creative vision so no ray tracing or no DLSS is definitely not in that contract The attorneys that write these contracts also will be wary of litigation so they will avoid anything that might seem anticompetitive despite the stereotype of sharklike lawyers doing anything for money Dudes FSRDLSS should not be even needed on high end GPU This sub is so negative nowadays Quite sad used to be that at least some discussion could happen Now its just shitting on AMD whatever they do while accusing everyone else of riding AMDs dick Ah well Ill be off the site in a few days anyways One sub less that Im sad for leaving shitting on AMD whatever they do And for good reason AMD needs to be called out on the bullshit they do like how we called them out for Ryzen 5000 not being supported on 400 series mobos With no dlss to fall back on to this means theyll make it work smoothly right  right The game will be CPU limited on just about any PC so itnot gonna matter much Edit I forgot about DLSS3 frame generation that would be good to have for sure This title should launch with FSR3 but AMD hasnt said anything about it since last year so who knows It would be the perfect title to launch it on though Meanwhile Puredark is currently testing DLSS3Frame Generation on Fallout 4 Just give him time and Im sure he will have it working with Starfield pending SFSE releasing Skyrim too actually Its tricky to get working though did he manage to get dlss 2 to work with fallout 4  Thats not good httpswccftechcomwhatsupwiththemissingnvidiadlsssupportinamdsponsoredfsrtitles everybody hates nvidia until a game ships without their tech Hopefully Microsoft will have the same h fuck thatsway Sony did when AMD apparently said they couldnsupport DLSS for their AMD sponsored games Also isnit weird how the graphics card companies pay game companies to allow the graphics card companies employees to work with the game developers Shouldnit be game devs paying for the expertise of people from ideally multiple graphics card vendors Just wonderful AMD continuing to spend all this money being exclusive partners with PC titles so they can block out DLSS and force their garbage FSR solution on everyone Its like theyve become the Epic games of GPU vendors spending all this money locking out the competition instead of trying to improve their shit technology I mean Im upset about no DLSS too but what you described is what Nvidia has been doing forever since PhysX I believe But yes Im also upset that we cant just have both FSR and DLSS in pc version these days because of AMD money being spent where it shouldnt This is disastrous all it effectively means is that DLSS  the vastly superior technology is going to be arbitrarily blocked on PC because of this partnership AMD trying to be Nvidia but failing to realize that when Nvidia did a bunch of underhanded shit they also had the best product at the time Ah so as long as they have the best products then its fine to pull scummy shit lol Shame all it will mean is less PCspecific features stripped down raytracingif theres any to make AMD GPUs rt performance look less pathetic while players will gain nothing from it If true that would be a blow FSR looks like ass and so far I can just throw GPU power at titles that dont support DLSS to render natively but Im not sure how viable that would be for Starfield I dont expect Bethesda to release a particularly optimized game FSR doesnt use hardware acceleration Unless this changes it will never match DLSS in quality Hopefully with all this pushback Microsoft forces a situation where it supports all three While most AMD sponsored games dont support DLSSXeSS Sonys ports are all surprisingly agnostic to GPU vendor tech There is no reason MS couldnt put the foot down here So funny to see all the AMD fans desperately trying to defend AMD oo guys AMD can do no wrong please only get mad at evil Nvidia  evil Intel AMD are the good kind of profitseeking corporation We went from PC store exclusivity to PC vendor exclusivity Im not excited about what the future holds for PC as a platform Itprobably because ita console exclusive AMD owns that space Easier to be a partner when more than half the player base will have AMD hardware I can already see it No DLSS3 or XeSS little to no RT and stupidly high vram usage Yeah definitely no DLSS 30 support All the planets will stay loaded in VRAM I guess Please dont lock it down AMD Let me guess no DLSS Getting real tired of this shit AMD sending in the engineers so they can be extra sure that theyre putting the AMD logo on yet another messy release I just dont get the strategy Itd be one thing if they were partnering with quality titles with good performance and could slap their name onto it for minimal effort but pretty regularly these AMD partnership games have been huge messes Thats what you want your brand on Are your engineers making things worse Or are they unable to fix these releases Either way is pretty bad Its just really funny AMD partnerships of late run pretty poorly on both their own and competitor CPUsGPUs I dont really see the latest Bethesda game changing that Exclusive deals make my dick soft Id wager Starfield will be the next AMD bundle following Jedi Survivor I suspected Immortals of Aveum as that is another AAA EA produced title sponsored bypartnered with AMD however both could be true with the former replacing Jedi and latter replacing RE4 Either way future AMD builders will be eating good w discounted GPU and AM5 platform costs Still not a fan of gatekeeping performance features tho If that means no DLSS they can go fuck themselves Shoutout to team 12 for their inevitable block of useful features AMD cant compete with Nvidia on upscaling frame generation or ray tracing and their market share is laughable so all they can do to appear competitive is pay to restrict features in games they sponsor It is blatant they do this recently and the goodwill they receive on Reddit compared to big bad Nvidia is laughable Apart from the upscaling perspective this is actually pretty interesting Metro exodus enhanced is one of the few ray traced titles that has global illumination that really runs well with AMD cards Its something that has been pointed out by DF several times Considering the game is said to have some form of GI maybe there is a ray traced GI solution that runs well even with AMD hardware like metro exodus Bethesda They still dont have ladders and vehicles in their games due to technical limits I am not joking about the ladder Starfield wont have ladders as well httpswwwredditcomrStarfieldcommentsnz6fbfseethatladderyoucantclimbitbethesdadoes Considering the game is said to have some form of GI maybe there is a ray traced GI solution that runs well even with AMD hardware like metro exodus DF guys said they dont think its RTGI but some other form of GI However the recommended specs for the game state a 6800XT or 2080 which suggests RT otherwise the 6800XT should be quite a bit faster than the 2080 Metro exodus is the fastest RT game I ever played on my 3080 and RT looks really good and adds a lot to the atmosphere Kudos to them Well the recommended specs 2080 and 6800 XT now look even more baffling DLSS support will probably be modded in quickly but Id bet dollars to doughnuts that mod wont work with the PC Game Pass version of the game so anyone looking to use such a mod will probably have to buy the game outright through Steam AMD is StarfieldExclusive PC Partner  FSR2 included Usually an AMD collab means no DLSS included will be interesting to see if that is the case Even if so it is likely to be modded in rapidly What this means for overall optimisation is unclear although they do mention multithreading optimisation in the video I really hope my 5600  6700XT will be enough for this game then lol Especially if this game is really CPUintensive Just fell to my knees at Micro Center Reminds me of myself trying to get a GPU a few years back If they collaborating with AMD why in gods name is the GPU hardware requirement so crazy high compared to Nvidia Most likely because the recommended is with RT on and AMDs RT is still lacking compared to Nvidia Because theyre collaborating with AMD laughs in capitalistic Actually disappointing DLSS is simply better in both quality and performance among other thing In other words  No DLSS or frame generation for nvidia users Well people will mod it quickly in for sure anyway official support will be alot nicer,2
2023-06-27,"AMD is Starfield's exclusive PC partner RIP DLSS Starfield's launch date is seeming awfully close to amd's fsr 3.0 launch (dlss frame gen alternative), won't be surprised if Starfield's the game the use to showcase it. So like Callisto Protocol, it will only have FSR and no DLSS There will be the DLSS mod for that anyways, AMD tries to lock dlss out of games but they aren???really. As an AMD GPU owner, it sucks to see this if they don't provide DLSS and XeSS....which judging by some recent AMD sponsored games, will end up being the case. Never a good thing when other resources are taken away from gamers due to BS sponsor deals. FSR 2.1, if utilized correctly, looks good but DLSS usually has the clearer recreation/results. The Xbox is built on AMD architecture. With Bethesda being a MSFT studio now, it makes sense that they would partner with the company that provided the hardware in the console that Starfield will run on. The PC side is just following that dev decision to optimize the game for Xbox. 3rd party exclusives and PC sponsorships suck. It doesn???matter who is doing it. These deals are anti-consumer. i hope this doesnt mean it wont have DLSS FSR2.1 is good but its not as good as DLSS Holy shit, so much whataboutism in the comments right now. It's incredible how hypocritical people are. Yes Nvidia has done very shitty things, that doesn't mean AMD gets a free pass. Call out anti-consumer practice's no matter who does it. Performance announcement What do you think 
Up Good
Down  I dont like it Starfield partners with AMD and oh boy, the internet is not happy God I hate articles that cite a few tweets or Reddit posts as ??뾦despread outrage?? Gaming journalism is an embarrassment. although I agree with you, reddit probably 90% of their clicks. This is a widespread journalism problem and is absolutely not limited to, or even more egregious in nature, to games journalism. That's because we're still waiting for the last AMD sponsored game to get fixed, two months after release. Which one would that be? I can't remember lmfao. This trend of ??봦e internet is not happy/freaking out??is the laziest, cringiest shit Reddit is freaking out about the internet freaking out about stuff, and Reddit is NOT happy Source: 1 tweet with 4 likes ""the internet"" is a few dozen people on Twitter and Reddit. lol I mean, it annoys me that I won't get dlss 3, but saying I'm outraged? Is a huge exaggeration tbh. The way people are posting in this thread you'd think this renders the whole game incompatible with intel/nvidia hardware instead of like, tiny performance and quality differences in a game that looks average regardless. How the fuck does PCGamer still exists? Why do people keep posting their stuff in here considering they're complete trash? AMD is losing what little market share it has to Intel. This is a rather desperate move, that is making them look really bad at the moment. A Marketing Disaster AMD is losing what little market share it has to Intel. It steadily gained market share from 2016 before levelling off in 2022, and there's an AMD chip in every PS4, PS5 and Xbox... Might be stating the obvious here but DLSS > FSR. Jedi Survivor would run better with DLSS in my opinion. Does this also mean no DLSS 3 for Starfield? Bummer for 40-series users then. If Starfield has Ray Tracing - - then good luck! Some people don't seem to want to hear it, but exclusives are anti consumer and that applies here too. There's no advantage to eliminating options for the end user. It's just raising artificial walls with the intent to increase revenue for company x or y. Hold up Aren???most games developed with a GPU partner? I remember for years upon years seeing an AMD or Nvidia splash screen when loading games. It's not the partnership that is the issue. It's the blocking of features from the rivals which directly lowers the quailty of games for all none AMD users. TSMC Expected to Charge $25,000 per 2nm Wafer Assuming $25k/wafer, something the size of the AD102 in a 4090 would be ~$245/chip assuming 100% yield. With TSMC's own claimed defect density for 5nm being 0.07/cm2, it brings the yield down to ~70% or ~$373/chip. Though, the actual yield would be even less because not all of them will meet performance requirements. Just a small clarification. A 4090 is not a full fat AD 102. Full fat AD102 currently only goes into the commercial line of products. 4090 is a cut down version of AD102, so it is in theory even cheaper, not more expensive, as 4090 uses essentially the defective chips from the AI/commercial/enterprise line.  3nm(or possibly a cheaper samaung/intel equiv) will likely be used for blackwell(5000 series n Nvidia) 2nm( or intel/samsung equivie) would be for the 6000 series . By then, like amd, we may very well see MCM design from Nvdia, which would allow  Nvidia is not using tsmc 2nm for their whole lineup . As wafer costs skyrocket, it would make much more sense to use a slightly older or cheaper node that has identical cache scaling . hmm N5 is 16k each right so if we do some simple maths, that means 2500 for the XX90 card on 2 nm? welp Though, the actual yield would be even less Its more complicated than that. A defect might land somewhere with redundancy. Furthermore, the 4090 is not a full fat die, it shuts off a significant chunk of the compute and cache, so if the defect lands on any of the parts that can be disabled it can still be harvested for a 4090. The yield in terms of ""how many dies can I use in a 4090 or better"" is going to be a lot _better_ than the 70% you mention here. I am looking forward to the 64bit memory bus 5060 TI However, in all seriousness, TSMC can not do this forever. Since companies will just refine older nodes or rebadge older products than use the new one. Of course they can do this forever as long as they are the only 2nm in town and macro demand keeps holding up. Simple economics. Car makers will keep buying their 12nm and phone makers will keep buying their 2nm for their variant of max pro. There?셲 no conflict in nodes sizes and one does not take away from the other. they can definitely do it right up until it doesn't work though. (TBD) A competitive foundry is so absurdly expensive to set up that real competition is a dream. They can push as hard as they like and if clients finally push back in a real way eventually they just pivot a bit and reach a compromise. Kinda expensive for a frisbee I miss the days when you could get an entire pyramid for $25000. Competition in future process nodes is needed. The waver prices shown in the list are way too high. lol no? 5nm was at 17k sometime ago Seems accurate to me for small volume pricing. Consider gross die per wafer and the fact that cost per wafer decreases with time. I eat a whole box of wavers in one sitting Especially with N7 reducing its price by less than 14% after 5 years, which seems ludicrous. Do you have an alternate source then? Especially 7, from what I remember it's approaching $7K per wafer Not as bad as I would have expected. I'd imagine early 5nm was probably 20k for customers. Source: I made it up Will the performance be announced around 530AM tomorrow Its morning right",2
2023-06-28," TSMC to Send More Taiwanese Workers to U.S. to Speed Up Arizona Fab . TSMC use Taiwanese workers AZ person here.

You know they're doing this to take advantage of the boatload of subsidy the U.S. are shelling out, right? It's a different type of incentive but basically the same idea of getting the foreign car manufacturers to open plants in the U.S. back in the day. I?셶e worked on one of these projects. They are doing it correctly. There is a HUGE amount of technical and institutional knowledge inside the heads of the workers in factories. IN THE IDEAL SITUATION you bring the entire team over from the original factory. They set up all the manufacturing equipment exactly like it was in the old factory. Every machine has quirks, and the people with experience on the machines are the best at setting things up. Once the factory is running properly, you have the original team train the new team. When the new team can run the factory right, you start sending the old team back home (to Taiwan in this case). Sure, it?셲 crazily expensive to bring a whole team over. But it costs much more to have a billion dollar factory produce unusable crap while inexperienced workers (no matter how well trained they are in a different environment) try to fix bugs. Gung-ho 80s flashback Meanwhile they are running off Union contractors by not paying them. The jobsite is a travesty with safety, they want their Taiwanese workers there so they can skirt safety regulations. Can?셳 call OSHA if you don?셳 speak English or don?셳 know it exists. I?셫 not on that job but a lot of my union brothers are. It?셲 a fucking nightmare, and I refuse to take a call to that job. Too bad they want folks to go to Taiwan for a year. Why not bring the training folks here? Probably because the working factory is over there. Hmm I thought the article stated that TSMC is shipping hundreds of people over to US Bought when the dividend was 4 in the beginning Stocks that I bought during COVID19 2020Its one of five companies and the dividend rate was 4 at the time

2023-07-03,AMD Screws Gamers Sponsorships Likely Block DLSS I never understood why theres such a tribal aggression behind Intel  Nvidia vs AMD Like its computer parts not warfare I know to me its the same as the whole iOS vs Android thing Its like who cares Just do whatever you canwant Its like a fuckin sports team or something For me Ive owned both card types and I just buy whatevers got a good deal going on when I upgrade Past few have been AMD and Ive never had any issues with any games old or new The console wars have come to PC Remember when games were able to run without having to use the crutch of AI upscaling Man thos e were the days Gaming in 2030 480p 20Hz upscaled and motion interpolated to 4k 144Hz Nah FSR and dlss is good you can ask people with 1650 1050Ti 1060 etc the life of these cards have been extended thanks to up scaling tech But using it as a crutch and launching games with poor performance on day 1 and relying on these technologies is also not good We have the console exclusives and now they want Upscaler exclusivesAMD This post has been flaired as a rumor please take all rumors with a grain of salt Im sure this will be taken well by some people This isnt the first time AMD is being shady These people that treat AMD and Radeon especially like they are saints are insane Sure you could make the argument that the shadiness of AMD is not as bad as the shadiness of NVIDIA or Intel in general remeber the old days but the fact stands ALL 3 companies are doing shady anti competitive stuff just that AMD does it less often than the other 2 The non answers are such a smoking gun it really says a lot without saying anything If the answer was no we dont block its very reasonable to assume theyd have said that already Public backlash got the 4080 12GB unlaunched we can make a difference so let AMD know that this is unacceptable Get ready for some world class mental gymnastics in this thread flaired as rumor lol I mean Im anti proprietary solutions I get it from a business perspective but its anti consumer in itself Upscaling needs a single open solution that works in every game that devs only have to implement once So I like AMDs stance on being open and FSR working on everything Its equally as bad when a game has DLSS but no FSR but it doesnt get this level of outcry for some reason BUT FSR isnt up to standard If it was the conversation would be irrelevant DLSS would just die if it offered no advantage to FSR and FSR would become the norm Theres no defense for AMD here If they want to become industry standard they improve FSR Period They dont restrict other options people have paid for To make matters worse Nvidia have already offered a compromise with streamline So all games would have upscaling that works on all 3 tech using the same code Intel joined AMD refused What I find hilarious are the people that come up with the typical excuse of but but Nvidia also did similar things or worse in the past Yeah and if there is one company that has been shit on every time theyve done shitty things its precisely Nvidia The problem is of the 3 upscalers FSR is the worst If you only have FSR then you canmake a comparison I play Cyberpunk 2077 a lot on my 6600xt When they added XeSS support I switched the that over FSR because the IQ is way better and I only lost a few frames Even patching in the latest FSR with a DLL swap didnhelp much AMD got close to DLSS pretty fast but they have not been advancing much since Intel has really surprised me too they are within spitting distance of DLSS now People in the youtube comments thinking theyre right to block DLSS because its not open source which is dumb in itself are forgetting that theyre excluding XeSS too And XeSS can be a better option than FSR depending on the implementation even on AMD hardware As a 4090 owner I donreally care about FSR and DLSS but as a gamer and techy my pitchfork is always lit You should because without DLSS support you cant use DLAA or DLDSRDLSS meaning youll be stuck with the native TAA I see a lot of people in the youtube comments defend AMD by saying Nvidia is just as bad with their DLSS and Hairworks and GSync and I think those people are really missing the point All of these Nvidia examples were situations where Nvidia had some kind of new proprietary technology and paid partners to include that technology in their product That is not to say that proprietary technology is great obviously it would be better if everything was open to everyone but that is unfortunately not the world we live in But it is fundamentally different from paying somebody to exclude the technology of a competitor as far as I am aware Nvidia has never stooped that low If AMD really did instruct their partners to exclude DLSS from their games then that is absolutely much worse conduct than pretty much anything Nvidia engaged in that I am aware of Nvidia really has done some extremely shady stuff in the distant past and thats part of the conversation I am pleasantly surprised that Nvidia feels so confident in their products and market position that they dont find it appropriate to kneecap AMD They certainly could abuse their market position and much higher cash flow of they wanted to The most pathetic thing about is that it REAPS of insecurity Theyre not confident with their own technology with both software and hardware so they do this Like I dont know how much this needs to get through AMDs thick skull with their GPU division You have less than 20 market share Most people do not buy your GPU products because you make objectively worse products than your main competitor and you have refused for years to compete on price If thats the case why would I buy your products as opposed to Nvidia You are literally relying on the fact that peoples disgust towards Nvidias attitude regarding their own customer base pushes them away and towards you but if you pull this crap people just go back to the better product Like just make better products or make them substantially cheaper than Nvidia Better yet do both I dont care how much X product costs to make with chiplets or monolithic or TSMC wafer prices this and that I dont care I dont have to care Its not my job to care The only thing customers need to care about is buying the better product or buy the equivalent product for cheaper Substantially cheaper Not the 6800 XT 50 cheaper Not the 6700 XT 20 cheaper Certainly not this generations prices The last time you made a product actually worth buying versus Nvidia was the 5700 XT at 100 or 20 cheaper than the 2070 and it wasnt even on purpose its because you got scared by the Super refresh so you dropped the price by 50 and tried to pathetically make it look intentional Unless youre not trying to actually sell your products and gain market share So just give up You know whats even sadder some dude will make a mod that implements DLSS and it will look better than the official FSR2 Thats right a mod will be superior to the baked in solution the developer made the trend continues modding is fixing the devs mistakes and yes I know the mod will be paid Lol amd fanboys be like Wfcctech article Denial GamersNexus video Anger and bargaining Im guessing this post is going to be a mix of both bargaining and depression Imo DLSS and XESS are better upscalers in most scenarios I think AMD is in the wrong if this is true It is locking customers to a worse option instead of improving their own upscaler to encourage people to prefer it I donthink there is a single triple a game where fsr actually looks better than dlss You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain AMD is not your friend TLDW AMD continues to avoid the question on if they are blocking DLSS on their sponsored titles No evidence or statement from anyone on if theyre actually doing it yet Just commentary on the fact that AMD is acting dodgy and because of that it seems likely they are blocking DLSS on AMD sponsored titles That moment when silence is the answer If they didnt do it they wouldve said it already its pretty obvious If theyre not doing it what value is there in not coming out and saying theyre not doing it Lol Its pretty clear theyre blocking DLSS and XeSS Classic Im not saying Im not doing it Everyone knows what that means they arent fooling anyone Paying to block features from a competitor is not going to bode well in court this there actually a legal case in this Ive seen this video posted on 3 subs now including this one Each of them are so ignorant to their own community issues that they completely missed the point of this video Lol Amd is slowly becoming what people said nvidia is Say what you want about nvidia but at least they allow the use of FSR Not that anyone wants to use FSR over DLSS AntofyABN is solving thescalability and high TXN fee problem using TXN fee blockchain Token Name AntofyABN Contract

2023-07-06,"9to5Google: ""Report: Google's first fully custom Pixel chip, Tensor G5, coming 2025 from TSMC"" How are they gonna do this and still price their phones below the competition? TSMC is expensive I mean the ultimate goal is to not price it below the competition and be able to compete as a premium brand. But also TSMC isn't that expensive if you manage costs well. Apple puts leading edge TSMC chips from flagship iPhones in $130 TV boxes. Phone chips are relatively tiny. There are around 600 100mm2 chips on a 300mm wafer. If they pay $16k per wafer each chip is ~$30. Phones generally have insane margins these days. They will be selling the chips to themselves, so they get a discount. No Qualcomm or Samsung middle man.  As a somewhat disappointed pixel 7 owner, I can confidently say this phone is midrange at best . Ya, still takes good photos, but if it's laggy while taking photos and worse during videos, that's not exactly inspiring . More than anything, good has quite poor QC and the competition is good enough now that pixels can no longer compensate for Google can comfortably sell at a loss in this space until their design and efficiencies of scale catch up. There is so much fab capacity coming online via TSMC and Intel (who aren?셳 as far behind as some think), that prices will come down hard in the next decade. Holy shit, that's actually incredibly exciting if true. The only reason why buying a Pixel is out of the question for me is their underpowered chipsets both designed and made by Samsung. It's gonna be really cool to see how well their design team can compete with Apple and Qualcomm when they're all on equal footing in terms of process node Exciting if true! They're kicking Exynos to the curb? Guess I'm keeping my Pixel 5 for another 2 years.. I am pretty sure this was an older rumor originated from Revegnus and that guy took back everything he said. Most interested to see if this I) entails a CPU cores or II) solely ?쏥oogle not using the Exynos team for the overall design and integration??  I would still entail II but II doesn?Â�� imply the former per se . Judging by the phrasing and gravity of it, my guess is this implies I, they?Â�l obviously be leaving but also integrating their own CPU cores into Tensor G5 . IMO custom cores are overrated, only Apple has designed better custom Arm cores than Arm Implementation still matters, Google could use huge L3 and SLC to give huge perf/efficiency advantages over other Android SoCs e.g. AnandTech found the Graviton2 has 32% higher IPC in SPECint2006 simply due to more cache than smartphone SoCs Although don't expect much, Google's current Tensor chips indicate they don't care about going after performance leadership IMO this is more about gaining independence, being able to fab at TSMC/Intel and use Qualcomm/MediaTek modems (Samsung Foundry and Exynos modems have been MAJOR weaknesses for Tensor so far) Can they stop using Sam?셲 Choice quality modems and go back to Qualcomm? Here's a prediction I am comfortable with: Its application CPUs are going to implement RISC-V ISA. Verge mentions this as something only Apple uses for the A series from TSMC which would make Google the only other one. Is what Apple use with the A series which is similar that much better than what google have currently with Samsung or what QC and MediaTek use with TSMC? I guess it?셲 just having the RAM on package. Apple made the G5 about 20 years ago, way to catch up Google, next we'll get the Tensor Core Duo. First fully custom Pixel chip, Tensor G5, coming in 2025 from TSMC Quite fitting for the pixel 10 Imagine if they pull an Apple and call it Pixel X lmao Glad they're moving away from Exynos and the inferior Samsung fabs. Should be large power efficiency gains for that reason alone. But that essentially makes Tensor G5 a ""gen 1"" SoC and Google's first ever fully custom design. I expect there will be growing pains and first gen type issues because of it. With how Samsung (and Intel for that matter) have been improving their process nodes recently and TSMC having troubles with 3nm it's very likely by 2025/2026 TSMC wont be the only acceptable option for flagships. By then we'll no longer see 8 gen 1 vs 8+ gen 1 improvements by switching fabs, it'll be more up to SOC configuration. Perfect timing to replace my 6 pro! I'm on the same 4 year cycle. Pixel 2 > 6 > 10 As long as they fix the modem I bought the 6 and basically beta tested the G1 and was thinking on upgrading the phone in 3-4 years so looks like I may be beta testing the next one as well I wish it was sooner but at least they're trying to improve. G1 -> G2 has been a much improved experience overall. I liked my P6Pro, and Like-Love my P7Pro. My biggest issue is the issues sending MMS. The modem on here hasn't been ideal. Welp, not upgrading until Pixel 10. As someone who moved from the pixel 2 > pixel 4a > pixel 7 pro.... I think this settles it for me. 2025 (or 2026 to allow for the 1st gen bugs to shake out) is my target for my post 7 pro upgrade. Thanks google...makes that easier to plan! I'd have to lol if by then, Samsung with their headstart on the 3nm process have the superior fab. This sub would lose their mind. Wasn't Tensor G1 supposed to be custom? What am I missing? It's semi custom; they took an Exynos SoC and replaced the parts that matters to Google (ex: AI cores, camera pipeline, etc) and kept the rest It was a Samsung chip that allowed customization (the tpu in this Google example) but the underlying hardware was still a Samsung chip with an added tpu This would make it possible to provide long term support. I'm in if it has 10 year software update support. Nothing is stopping Google from increasing support for the current Tensor chips. Only google is stopping google from doing this right now.

Hi there, I gave that a go but after restarting my computer my display manager refused to start and I was just presented with a black screen. I have managed to get it working however, after reading through the Arch wiki on Nvidia prime. Are you trying to connect two external monitors in addition to the built-in laptop monitor? If so, be aware that some (or maybe most?) Laptops only support having 2 monitors at a time. On the other hand you mentioned nvidia, So it could be one monitor is controlled by the iGPU (GPU integrated in the CPU), while the other is controlled by nvidia's dGPU. If that's the case here's some interesting reading that might help: https://wiki.debian.org/NVIDIA%20Optimus I am only trying to connect 1 external monitor and the other monitor is the built-in display for the laptop. I have read through the debian page for optimus and it didn't help much, except for the link at the bottom to the Arch wiki which did have the solution for me (reverse prime). Thanks everyone for your help. I managed to get it sorted after reading through the Arch linux wiki for Nvidia PRIME. First I made a fresh xorg.conf file and added the following lines to it (from the Arch wiki).  Section ""ServerLayout"" ""Server layout"" ""Screen 0 ""intel"" ""Inactive ""nvidia"" ""Device"" ""Modesetting"" ""BusID"" ""PCI:0:2:0"" ""Portable"" is a reference to a previous version of this article . After doing that and restarting x I ran xrandr --listproviders and seen that it now had 2 providers listed. After that I then ran the command xrandr --setprovideroutputsource NVIDIA-G0 I was then able to see the display in KDE display manager and configure it. I believe after I restart I will need to run the same command again, so I am going to add it to my display manager scripts to start automatically (as the Debian article suggests).  I am having the same issue but am not knowledgeable enough to know whether I can just take the steps you/the Arch wiki outline with my current setup or if that will ruin everything . I have installed nvidia-driver, do you know if I can leave that installed? Also, what exactly do you mean when you say that you restarted",2

Its not Samsung or HynixIts not NVIDIADo you have a micron shareholder I Am Voting For Joe Biden In 2024 I didn't vote for the guy in 2020. And maybe I feel the way I feel because I went into his presidency with low expectations, after all he did say nothing would fundamentally change. But dammit if I haven't been surprised on more than one occasion. Legislative Achievments Two note worthy pieces of Legislation President Biden signed into law are the Infrastracture Bill and the CHIPS Act. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684 This is the most signicant investment in our nations infrastructure in decades. Some of things in this bill include Delivering clean water to more American families by eliminating the nation?셲 lead service lines.  Getting more Americans access to reliable high-speed internet. Repairing and rebuilding our roads and bridges Improving transportation options for millions of Americans and reducing greenhouse emissions through the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Upgrading our nation?셲 airports and ports to strengthen our supply chains. Making the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak.  Building a national network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers.  Delivering the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells.  CHIPS and Science Act https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346 The CHIPS and Science Act provides funds to support the domestic production of semiconductors and authorizes various programs and activities of the federal science agencies.  CHIPS and Science Act provides $52.7 billion for American semiconductor research, development, manufacturing, and workforce development . Act includes $39 billion in manufacturing incentives, including $2 billion for the legacy chips used in automobiles and defense systems . It also provides a 25 percent investment tax credit for capital expenses for manufacturing of semiconductors . As President Biden would say, these pieces of Legislation are a BFD - Big Fucking Deal. And you can say ""anyone could of done this"" then why didn't the former president? When Republicans last had full government control the most significant legislation they passed was a 2Trillion dollar Tax Cut that cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. I've also been surprised at Bidens ability to not only be Bipartisan and give Republicans the opportunity to work together, but he knows when to put his foot down. I've also been pleasantly surprised at his willingness to call out traitorous MAGA Republican and the dangers they pose on the Nation, while constantly reminding that these folk are a loud minority of the Republican Party. And people say ""oh he's too old you are voting for Harris"" Bullshit. Yeah, he's old as fuck and at times it does show, he's EIGHTY, but I've been hearing the same thing said since 2020 and every year the goal post gets moved. I listen to his speeches in their entirety. I've watched how he gets around. I've worked in a Nursing Home/Rehabilitation Center. Dudes in better shape then ANYONE I had encountered during my time there. He's got a 2nd term in him, there is ZERO doubt in my mind about that. Is he everything I want in a President? No. But at the end of the day it's coming down between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. As President after losing the election Donald Trump attempted to disregard the votes of millions Americans across seven states by putting pressure on State Officials. His Team also set up Fake Electors across 7 States he lost, including my state of PA. He attempted to subvert the Constitution and the will of the people in order to steal and election he KNEW he lost from the very beginning. Would I rather have someone younger than Joe? Yeah, and in 2028 I will get that. Hoping for a Shapiro/Newsom ticket. I do not see any reason not to vote Joe Biden in the 2024 Election, but I am happy to hear why I shouldn't and I will answer any questions. Evidence the CHIPS and Science act is already doing work, Total Construction Spending: Manufacturing in the United States is through the roof: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TLMFGCONS Oregon is working really hard laying the groundwork to get some of that sweet sweet CHIPS money I agree with your sentiment, but I still have massive concerns over his age despite his policy wins. And the same applies to Trump. Cognitive decline is undeniable when you get that old, the risk of death is very real. However these are the candidates that are being shoved down my throat so what choice do I have. I feel like Republicans need a really bad recession or something worse for Biden to not win in 2024. Currently Dems seem well poised to win back the House and keep the WH and Senate. This is part of what worries me. I wouldn't put it past them to engineer something really bad just so they have better chances at winning. They already seem to have no issues with utterly reinterpreting the constitution if it benefits them. Really what they need is Trump and DeSantis to slip into a coma from now until after the election so they can run someone half sane and have a shot at winning. But right now Republicans are intent on driving Dem turnout with two frontrunners who are legit terrifying to the average American DNC squeezes a lot out of their interns. Is that you Jen Psaki?  I'm voting for Biden, I like what he's got done and what he is trying to get done, but I also feel he has a Presidential vibe that we have sorely missed . I like not having to hear dumb opinions from Trump every day lol. I like a guy that isn't going out of his way to divide the country. I  I'm not excited about Biden, but he hasn't done anything completely stupid that has screwed anything up, he's the most peaceful president in the past 20+ years . While inflation sucks, we are doing better than most of the rest of the world in that regard and the economy is stable, and it's overall been a return to normalcy Nor anyone who echoes or enables him. Until they disentangle themselves from Trump and Trumpism, all Republicans are a complete no-go. I rather suspect that will be true for the rest of my life. If it?셲 Trump vs Biden, I?셫 voting Biden simply because Biden does not encourage political violence. I?셫 not a fan of either of their politics. How much are you paid to do this ? The age thing worries me, not because I?셫 worried about his age, but because I?셫 worried other people will let it drive themselves to distraction. They will no doubt forget that Trump is roughly the same age and much dumber, because of the hair dye. But in reality it?셲 a silly thing to worry about. Reagan wasn?셳 terrible because he had dementia in office, he was terrible because of his policies from day one. The thing people seem to miss is that, for all we know, Biden?셲 agenda is already being handled by the administration and staff. And if Biden dies, that?셲 what we have a vice president for. But I fully expect the American people to do what they usually do and mistake a presidential election for a reality show where only the most shallow things matter. Which 3 letter agency do you work for? The infrastructure bill was only going to spend 6% of the funds on actual hard infrastructure. The rest is pork You've experienced 25 straight months of declining real wages, and the national deficit is on it's way to $50 trillion. That's a great reason not to vote for Biden Biden's plan includes $621 billion for transportation, $400 billion for homecare service, $300 billion for manufacturing and $180 billion for research and development. Under their ""traditional"" definition of infrastructure, the GOP email limits what counts as infrastructure spending to include the $115 billion the plan allocates for modernizing highways, roads and main streets, $25 billion to airports and $17 billion for inland waterways, ports and ferries. However, Biden's plan also calls for $85 billion to modernize public transit, $80 billion for Amtrak, $50 billion to safeguard critical infrastructure and $20 billion to improve road safety. The GOP email does not provide an explanation for why those investments are not considered part of infrastructure.  Infrastructure accounts for about 30% of the $2.65 trillion plan as announced by the White House . $235 billion additional funding for transportation infrastructure, $126 billion for building housing units, $112 billion to build public schools and improve community college facilities . Anyone who freaks out about the National debt simply doesn't understand it and conflates it with Personal Debt. A Nations Debt and Personal Debt are not alike. Firstly, the debt is not structured like the loans you take from a bank. Most of it is in Treasury Bonds. These are bought; you too can buy treasury bonds. It's actually an excellent save investment, as it won't make you much profit but it's stable. So it's not like the US is begging China for money. Rather, they, believing in the stability of the US economy, decide to purchase US Treasury Bonds. This incidentally gives the U.S power--the countries who buy bonds have a vested interest in the success of our economy.  The US government was never, ever failed a payment, and as such we pay an absolutely tiny interest on the debts . Sometimes our inflation is higher than the interest, and on those years we make money from the debt . You can into more of how the debt is useful. For one, it's what makes up most of currency, as Treasury Bonds are the most common collateral on dollars. As long as the debt grows at a similar rate to our GDP, it's not a problem. And so far our debt is well within acceptable limits. But too much debt isn't necessarily good either; for one, it can cause runaway inflation like Venezuela.  The US is a sovereign currency issuer, has an extremely large and powerful military, has nukes, borrows at extremely attractive interest rates and in its own currency, and also the dollar is the global reserve currency . National debt can be a major and bad issue for countries that do not have these attributes of course . Im sorry you've been tricked into worrying about the national debt. It's honestly crazy how you folk will just repeat a little lie you're told like that ""7%"" nonsense that takes 5 seconds to disprove. Please, do better cheif. This is the funniest shit I have ever read",0

Der bekannter Gestank von Urin, Abfall, Erbrochenem und Meer wurde durch sanften Regen gemildert. In diesen fr체hen Morgenstunden war es klamm und Mae zitterte leicht. Ob es aufgrund das Wetters, oder von den eben gesagten Worten von Vitus herr체hrte, war unm철glich zu sagen. ""Aber das bleibt unter uns!"", sagte Vitus, ""versprich es mir, kein Wort zu den Anderen."" ""Oookay"" ""lass uns wieder reingehn, Quintin sollte nicht solange allein sein."" Die nachfolgenden Minuten verflogen im Flug, Mae war auf Autopilot. Ihre Gedanken kreisten nur um Vitus...

Then the smaller one disappeared and the larger one confirmed. How do I resolve? The Revolut app says to contact the merchant, but I have no idea how to contact an oil company (Eni) about a self-serve transaction.  With the receipt, your chances for chargeback should be good .

Whereas Taiwanese will work long hours under intense pressure to put food on the table, Americans just ain't going to do that. There is a great documentary that follows a U.S. based glass factory during a Chinese takeover. And you see this exact thing. It?셲 called American Factory and it?셲 on Netflix. I have a friend who?셲 an electrician and what he says no electrician wants to work at that job site, it?셲 been temps there the entire duration so far and temps can be very unreliable.

They want workers who will work unlimited hours for below average pay in the field. Something similar happened when Toyota brought some car plants to America and found quality and efficiency was terrible and blamed it on American workers not wanting to work hard and only under ideal conditions.

TSMC delays U.S. chip plant start to 2025 due to labor shortages Process engineering here. Few of us want to do our jobs long term. R&D peers get better pay, better hours and just overall better jobs. I read a bit ago that they are requiring engineers to work in Taiwan for several months or maybe even years? Which for many is a non starter. Former process engineer here. We specialized in reinstrumentation. I left after a couple of years to go directly into software engineering. Far better pay, better hours, no more 80-100% travel time to BFE, and I get to stay indoors all day. If you pay them, they will come. Same guy was complaining last month that people should work for them because of passion instead of wages. They want to import their exploitative working conditions to the US and thankfully it's looking like they're not having any luck doing it. the US tmsc plant exists because us govt wants semiconductor capabilities in US soil, and the plant is subsidized by US taxpayers. tsmc themselves probably don't care if it starts early or gets delayed indefinitely. Yeah, I remember reading an interview a while back that just made me laugh. Don't remember the exact figures, but it was something like ""The working conditions are really generous. Engineers might show up at 7am and leave by 7pm, and you get at least one day off a week."" It was just completely ridiculous. Equipment installation, maintenance and process engineering are the least thankful professions in a chip plant. You get all the blame and never a thank you while working long hours and handling extremely toxic chemicals all day (and sometimes radiation too). All this while getting mediocre pay at best. If you can don't go into the semiconductor business, all in all it sucks and from my experience a large percentage of the long term workers never get to benefit from their retirement package because they die from cancer. Archived version here as well. https://archive.li/HdLIo TAIPEI -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said it will push back the start of mass production at its plant in Arizona to 2025 due to a shortage of skilled workers and technicians needed to move equipment into the facility. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu said the world's biggest contract chipmaker is entering a critical phase of handling and installing some of the ""most advanced equipment"" at the plant, its advanced first chip facility in the U.S. in more than 20 years. Mass production was previously slated to begin late next year. ""We are encountering certain challenges, as there is an insufficient amount of skilled workers with the specialized expertise required for equipment installation in a semiconductor-grade facility,"" Liu said. He added that TSMC is sending experienced technicians from Taiwan to make up for delays and the lack of trained local workers, confirming a Nikkei Asia report last month. Construction of the Arizona plant began in mid-2021. ""We expect the production schedule of N4 process technology to be pushed out to 2025,"" the chairman said, referring to 4-nanometer chipmaking technology.  TSMC is seen as a barometer of the wider tech industry . It now expects a 10% decline in revenue from 2022 . In April, it trimmed its annual revenue target from mild growth to a ""low-to-mid single digit"" decline . The chipmaker also reported its first drop in quarterly net profit since 2019 on Thursday amid a slump in the consumer electronics market.  Revenue for the April-June quarter was 480.84 billion New Taiwan dollars ($15.68 billion), the lowest in five quarters . Net profit was NT$181.80 billion, down 23.3% on the year . ""It's all about macroeconomics. In fact, higher inflation and interest rate [hikes] impact demand Apart from its AI-related business, TSMC expects weakness in other areas in the second half of the year, the CEO said. The Taiwanese chipmaker also predicted a lukewarm current quarter, with revenue of between $16.7 billion and $17.5 billion, a decline of about 15.4% at the midpoint from last year.  TSMC said planned capital expenditure for this year will remain between $32 billion and $36 billion . TSMC is benefiting from the boom in generative artificial intelligence led by ChatGPT . AI computing requires the powerful graphics processors made by Nvidia and AMD . AMD CEO Lisa Su, who is in Taipei this week to visit clients and suppliers, told reporters on Wednesday that AI will be the most important growth driver for the next few years. ""AI is in the birth stage of a very large growth, [and is] a key area of investment for us,"" Su said. ""We believe over the next three to four years the [total addressable market] can be over $150 billion."" TSMC is the sole manufacturer of AMD's powerful MI300 platform for high-performance computing and large cloud computing -- its answer to Nvidia's H100. Su said AMD will continue to work with the Taiwanese contract chipmaker for its next-generation product. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also said TSMC will remain the company's sole supplier for the H100 processor due to the technological barrier and its deep partnership with the Taiwanese chipmaker. Mark Li, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said in a research note that TSMC may benefit from iPhone processor orders in the current quarter and should see more obvious demand related to AI in the last quarter of 2023.  ""It will take nearly six months to turn [those orders] into revenue,"" Li said . Demand from PCs, Android smartphones and other consumer electronics is still softer than expected . Ahh yes. Labor Shortage claims. The cry of the financial oppressor. It takes a specialized skill set to be able to work in these facilities and to do the construction work. Not just anybody can do this work without years of training. Translation: they couldn?셳 find the same people in Taiwan where they can exploited for 100hrs work week Translation: We can't find the skilled workforce willing to get paid less for the same job that pays 20k to 30k more down the street from our competitor I honestly would love to work here. But why did they have to put it in Arizona... a huge water consumption plant in AZ makes no sense to me. There are plenty of abandoned coal/paper plant sites around the south with practically unlimited water. Very disappointing. Any company that says ?쐋abor shortage??nowadays, to my ears, is just admitting they don?셳 want to pay fair wages. Stop calling it a ""labor shortage"", there are plenty of qualified people. Call it what it is, a wage shortage. It's not due to the difference in workhours is it... Asian norms are very harsh compared to the US ones, can't be kept abroad.
Good luck to the plant's future! Pieces of shit working people to the bone and then dumping them for fresh meat once they burn out. There is no labour shortage. There is a good pay shortage. Pay them 3x their current salary and the labour shortage will magically disappear.",0
2023-07-20,"TSMC Delays Arizona Fab Deployment to 2025, Citing Shortage of Skilled Workers ""shortage of skilled workers"" Can be rewritten as ""we won't pay for skilled workers"" They roll into a town that has been building semiconductors from day 1. Motorola, Intel, etc. etc. They try to poach those employees by offering less pay, more hours, mandatory travel abroad, and a harsher work envitoment. They'll be lucky if Intel doesn't poach TSMC's best and brightest. Strange that Americans aren't jumping at the chance to work every waking hour of their lives away for minimal pay. ?ㅇ?뤋?띯셽截?$TSMC It?셲 easier to blame the American workforce than admit the project was poorly planned and they can?셳 retain workers. They brought hundreds of engineers and technicians to Taiwan for 6-18 months to train. That is sufficient time to be trained if there was a plan in place to train people??$TSMC I say this as someone working in semi. Yup. I know a few people who trained and are working there. Terrible place to work from what I?셶e heard both in design and construction side Other headline: ?쐗orkers cite shortage of pay and work life balance??$TSMC Asia culture meets US culture. Edit. Recommended viewing ""American Factory"". Not Taiwan but Asian nonetheless for cultural differences. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Factory Wow. Harsh. TSMC on Thursday disclosed that it will have to delay mass production at its Fab 21 in Arizona to 2025, as a lack of suitably skilled workers is slowing down the installation of cleanroom tools. The company also confirmed that it is sending in hundreds of people familiar with its fabs from Taiwan to Arizona to assist the installation.  ""We are encountering certain challenges, as there is insufficient amount of skilled workers,"" said Mark Liu, chairman of TSMC . ""We expect the production schedule of N4 process technology to be pushed out to 2025,"" he said . Correction: TSMC fab delayed due to inability to find skilled workers that will work 18 hours a day for peanuts. Strange i don't recall Intel ever having this issue. They have it now, mostly due to TSMC. There?셲 a Documentary on Netflix about Asian Work Culture meeting American Work Culture, its called American Factory. Its quite eye opening on how much disdain American Work Life is viewed with. They ended up with a ton of robotics in the end and openly admit to looking for ways to remove workers??Shits wild GREAT documentary that I can?셳 help but think of every time I read one of these articles I remember them asking the people at the China factory how much they work and if they had families. People had little kids and dont see their families but once maybe twice a year. The founder of the company said the purpose of life was to work. He also was gaslighting those employees telling them dont think about how much they are being paid but to think about how this helps their country to move forward. It?셲 not a shortage of skilled workers. It?셲 a shortage of skilled workers willing to work under those conditions. Terrible company and CEO (C. C. Wei) to boot. Reminds me of Elon Musk in that they exploit workers through making them work long hours with poor pay. Imagine not having a set work schedule and being on-call. Your weekend trip planned months to weeks ahead suddenly hits a roadblock due to silicon machinery malfunctioning. They tried to hire me (used to work in the industry), but it was for a major pay cut from my at the time similar job, and more hours, with no OT. Definitely not a lack of skilled workers. Low paid, high skilled workers they mean. TSMC Delays Start of First Arizona Chip Factory, Citing Worker Shortage I don't see a single recruiter reaching out to me only 200miles away, yet the fab companies in LA and silicon valley do. I don't think they're trying. Oh they're trying, to get cheap h1b. Yeah I am much closer. I have heard they the salaries and the work life balance aren?셳 great. Most likely they are going to do the same thing Foxconn did in Wisconsin  Engineers in Taiwan make like $50k a year and work 6 days a week or more on-site . No American engineer is going to sign up for that . This is a political ploy .  TSMC is well known to be terrible to work for while having low. Plus their factory is in the middle of nowhere Arizona . They are not going to get talented engineers that currently have high paying jobs in desirable locations . TSMC cant pay employees a fair wage and will pay as minimum as possible wondering why no one wants to work. Maybe if they could afford workers? I work in, and hire in, this field. The US doesn't have 10% of the fab workers it needs to onshore semiconductor fabs. We're struggling to find workers at $100 an hour. They don't exist. They can afford workers - in Taiwan. That's why they built their working fabs in Taiwan, and not in the USA. They only built this fab in Arizona due to political pressure from the US government. No, it is not due to short wages. You can't just hire any Joe Sixpack off the street to work in a semiconductor fab. To give you an idea of the skill level required, in Taiwan, TSMC hires engineers with doctorate degrees as technicians to operate the fab equipment. Such individuals in the USA are scarce, and would cost upwards of US$150K each. They can be hired in Taiwan for less than US$40K. That has more to do with oversupply of skilled labor in Taiwan and norms there. A PhD is hyper focused on contributing to science by creating a piece of new research; only a small fraction of that time would be spent on skills necessary to become proficient technician. Technician is a different role and there is no reason why you need a PhD to do that. https://ro.careers.tsmc.com/job/Phoenix-Equipment-Technician-AZ-85001/774726210/ According to this post technician minimum qualifications for technician in Arizona is associates in science and engineering. I don't know shit so maybe that's just what they put and they only higher people better than that. 150K and many incentives would be rock bottom for me, no 18 hour days, no insourcing your slave culture to me. But first the industry would have to admit that (like I said back then) outsourcing to China was bad policy and they were lying when they said it would cause them to democratize. So nothing to see here I'm tired of these articles claiming there is a worker shortage. There is only a shortage of people willing to work for below market wages in these positions. You never see articles complaining about a shortage of C suite workers despite their obscene pay packages. With an aging population, boomers aging out en mass, and nearly frozen immigration, it isn't surprising that there aren't enough people to do all the work that needs doing. This stalled factory is an analogy for the whole economy if we're not careful. It's wild how all this feeds into itself. Ppl living longer also means ppl are working longer. So the upward mobility has stagnated. Means purchasing power of largest population isn't what it was projected to be. Anecdotally, my neighborhood is a prime location for middle class families but is full of retirees with huge, empty homes. I'm this micro case, maybe they need to offer better packages. Also, unemployment isn't terrible ATM so there's not a desperation for work. I would be willing to bet they are trying to pay to little. There are tons of people who want. Meh, I work in this industry right now. It's busy, but it's not THAT busy. The real issue is getting a hold of the stuff you need to install... the tubing, piping, valving, etc. and not Tool Install or installation contractors. So, in that universe, claiming you can't find staff is the politically correct way to hide the fact from the world that you fucked up and didn't order shit early enough. Claiming you don't have a pipe fitter to install a component is an easy way to hide the fact that the ""materials I build a fab with"" supply chain needs 48 weeks ARO lead time for a high purity PVDF piping tee and you only ordered it 16 weeks ago. Even this situation isn't as simple as ""manufacturing needs to step up"", it is literally PVDF resin shortages at the petrochemical plant level. All the manufacturers are in the same boat. Can't just pay more to have it earlier. Just one example of many. Remember, a subfab and tool install consists of thousands of smaller size high purity tubing and high purity valves. There are only so many high purity valves manufactured into existence in a given year. And, I don't know, let's say you're TSMC and you lost the battle with Intel, Samsung, and other companies building out subfabs which contain THOUSANDS of 1/2"", 3/4"" and 1"" high purity valves that comprise a subfab fit up and a whole tool install cycle, and now you are last in line. Many of these companies are SO CHEAP, that rather than risk buying 10% too many valves or 3/4"" valves when 1/2"" valves will do, they'll FAFO and wait until they convince themselves they won't order too many. TSMC is in the FO portion of FAFO right now. Intel and Samsung were not stupid.  The irony of this whole tool install and subfab buildout issue is that even if they could build it all, they won't have sufficient tool owner engineers to run them anyway . US based engineers don't have the same tolerance as Taiwanese when it comes to being treated like slave labor . Only the desperate will go to Taiwan for six months to a US semiconductor work already borders on slave labor, and TSMC's ""standard"" makes THAT work look like a vacation. But again... the real delay here IMO is material shortages; which, unfortunately are THEIR FAULT, so you know... have to claim you can't find workers. Cause that's not your fault. ""Look at all this work I got here... nobody wants to work anymore."" TSMC Phoenix Cuts (IBEW)Electrician Pay and Sends In Taiwanese Workers Remember that time you payed yourself to go build a place and then they gave the work away? Dont fall off the cliff of ""those goddamn workers are taking our jobs!"" The company and its leadership made this decision. Organize the workers and show them de way so it blows up in the companies face. All this article talks about is the low scale but doesn't mention the overfull portable toilets and general poor conditions. Is this one of those states where you can voluntarily join the union and then be part of their contract and then make the same wages? Shouldnt this be easy to get the new workers on board? No one wants to work there, the place sucks Literally burn the fucking place to the ground. 3rded I?셫 with this FYI, Taiwan has an Electrician's Union. https://tplu.org.tw/ Good luck having anything to code. More work for future legitimate electricians. I'm sure they are great maintenance electricians and are more than adequate for troubleshooting and hooking up equipment though. Was thinking that myself only way I see this shit getting passed is some Inspectors getting paid off! Blame the local officials for allowing this to happen. People should be protesting at the governor office. Is there no license requirement in Arizona? The internet is unclear on it. This would get shut down in WA immediately, gotta have an EL-01 to touch construction electrical. Only contractor licenses. Shit like that puts a lot of downward pressure on wages. I?셫 sure that?셲 why they chose for it to be built in Arizona. They plan for all of this, anyway to cut costs. I ain?셳 going to Phoenix to work. Our pay is shit, but our pension is also shit... So? New officers elected; however, IDK how effective they'll be Brother Eric just posted a video about this on his Unionminded YouTube channel. Check it out if you haven't. TSMC delays US chip fab opening, says US talent is insufficient  Since the mid-2000s, SWEs have been paid 2x in total compensation relative to their HWE peers . The cream of the crop American talent in tech has moved towards software . Only Apple, Nvidia, and to a lesser extent Broadcom is worth working at in the US if you want well paying salaries . Opening a fab is a very unique skill. Very few fabs have opened over the past decade in the US. Key quote from the article: ?쏱eople don?셳 seem to realize that when we start building those fabs across the globe now and are everywhere, that skill has been refined over the last couple of decades in only a few places on the planet?봯redominantly in Taiwan and in Korea and a bit in China,??said Wennink. (ASML CEO) Also worth noting: ""the union contractor refused to hire the non-union workers ""since union contractors only use workers dispatched from the union hall"" and predicted that TSMC would continue to struggle to recruit American workers unless the company raised wages."" - their electrical contractor  There are several IC wafer companies in Taiwan with TSMC being the largest . All now hire employees from other countries . US professionals prefer to work remote under their own terms . IT guy here. I wanna chill in my chair all day in my office solving problems not be in a clean room all day hunched over in factory assembly lines. Fuckkkk thattty I?셝 be curious to know how much of a pay cut (cost of living adjustment) an equivalent engineer would have to take - if coming from Bay Area or elsewhere Taiwanese workers don?셳 want to pick up the slack when their American counterpart refuses to work hella overtime, which is a standard for TSMS in tw. I work for another American chip company and honestly I get their point. Salaries are not the problem, TSMC already pays enough in Taiwan, but the lack of talent is real. I would say that 80% of the engineers in my company are either from Taiwan or India And does anyone remember that the original reason US outsourced chip processing to Asians was because Americans didn't want to do the tedious and tiring work? In truth ?쏹S talent at our shitty salary bands is insufficient and we are unwilling to boost pay to compete.??$TSMC Oh, so that's every Taiwanese company, not just schools. So expected... Who would of thought that money can't buy government secrets/talent. Plus Taiwanese engineers are used to working long hours. Western concept of US worker rights can't compete. (for good or bad). Let me translate it to you: The best of the best in the sector is not willing to be our slave working 25h a day and getting paid a mediocre salary (given US standard for such high end of employees) for a position with draconian conditions.  TSMC in Taiwan while is not paying bad, for Taiwan standard, conditions are terrible . I have heard stories of people quitting and creating their own bubble tea store coz they don't want to work in that sector .  Taiwan has many great things, but the work environment is not one of those . Most of the job offers in Taiwan, under the benefits section specifically mention that you have 2 days off work a week, like it?셲 something great and worth to be added as additional benefits . aka pay and working conditions are awful so talented engineers in the US would rather work somewhere else Meanwhile, Americans are arguing about usefulness of getting a college education and Republicans are refusing to help student loans For semiconductor manufacturing, the ""talent"" is no less than willing to work overtime extensively for free and be on call 24 hours. Taiwan has this even amongst their smartest people, who are indeed both smart and willing to work voluntarily without asking for as much as, say, the US for most people. There's a few issues- right now, software based jobs pay as well or better with more flexibility in better locations. 2. There's competition for jobs in semiconductor fields with jobs in more desirable locations (I.e. Intel in Oregon, GF in NY, Micron in Idaho, a bunch of smaller scale stuff in SV). The people I know at these locations have no problem with the on call schedule, distance restrictions, etc. In part because they are desirable locations. 3. There's a lot of smaller companies with equal better pay that are not in traditional semiconductor work competing that compensate well, lower stress, and more desirable locations. Many transferable skills work with quantum computing (see MSFT, Honeywell), other hardware (see Apple, for example, or Facebook, or Neurolink, etc). 4. You can also go into an equipment supplier company and have less stress, like LAM, ASML, Bruker, Raith, Zeiss, etc. 5. Thin film experience and characterization also goes well with the rapidly growing battery industry. The US has a ton of jobs in these areas. Arizona is a poor location for attracting talent. There is a lot of options for workers. Its rough. I've talked to my PhD classmates. None of them will even consider Arizona as an option. AZ, despite the tax advantages, is just a poor location for bringing domestic talent. Which means the compensation needs to be way higher than elsewhere. From what I?셶e heard, they?셱e hiring at salaries close to what they pay in Taiwan. Hence no one wants to put up with the bullshit. TSMC reports first profit drop in 4 years as electronics demand slump continues Marked up prices like crazy so companies ordered less not shocking More like, their clients started to mark up prices like crazy, seeing those margins, they decided that their clients could pay more, so they raised up prices. Chip designers were the harbingers of those prices. Everything is getting more expensive but wages continue to not rise, of course people are buying less. But even still I doubt this will cause TSMC to change course in the slightest. Not surprise when last year ""TSMC, the world?셲 largest chipmaker by volume and revenue, is planning a 5% to 8% increase after hiking advanced chip prices by 10% and less advanced chip prices by 20% in August."" But having said that, it is a bit confusing as Toyota still doesnt even give out 2nd key fobs citing chip shortages. They also blame chip shortages still to this day on why certain car models arent made more like the Primes. Ignore this report, because it was caused by companies buying too many parts during the COVID era, since they were scared they couldn't get more parts in a reasonable amount of time. If a company bought lots of electronic components, they likely will wait until their inventories have dropped before buying more parts. It's this darn simple to understand this issue. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullwhip_effect And people were eating up their ""labor shortage"" excuse as the reason for the Arizona 2025 delay. TSMC's forecasts of continued reductions in global demand/GDP, not labor or ""lazy American workers"", are why they delayed Arizona. It still made 5,800,000,000 USD in net profit in 3 months. That's insanely profitable. It?셲 a public company everything is trends. The company has a market value of about 500B so no, that is not ""insanely profitable."" More like the minimum expected level of profitability for a company when investors could just as easily earn 5% in low/no risk fixed income markets. Well of course, the lockdown and mining boom are over. If you ignore that anomaly, how bad are the numbers really? Maybe lower your damn prices? Feel free to drop the price of everything. There's a chip glut now so US TSMC plant is probably going to be postponed. TSMC will of course still raise prices TSMC warns of deepening chip slump as AI boom fails to offset economic woes The world?셲 biggest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, has warned of a deepening semiconductor slump, as the boom in artificial intelligence fails to offset global economic woes and China?셲 delayed recovery. TSMC now expects its 2023 revenue to drop by 10 per cent, rather than the less than 5 per cent it forecast three months ago, the Taiwanese company told investors on Thursday. This would translate into a 15 per cent revenue decrease in the second half of the year, compared with the same period in 2022. https://www.ft.com/content/f433971d-fd8e-4ed3-91e9-e25a96284ea0 Since apparently no one read the full article. TLDR:
AI related chips are in a shortage
Low End Chips (Cars, Phones, Devices) have had a very significant decline this guy reads... or is this chat gpt? Low End Chips (Cars, Phones, Devices) have had a very significant decline. Wait, I thought chip shortages on cars were affecting sales, right VW? Or is just an excuse to say you don?셳 sell cars who wouldve thought that the current AI trend wouldn't fix the systemic failure of the economy on multiple levels Someone just needs to go on TV and scream ""AI AI AI AI AI AI!!!"" and we can save the economy!!! /s simply raise the price 10% what are they gonna do? Go to another chip supplier?  TSMC has already raised price not so long ago . MediaTek, Boeing and Qualcomm some other big dudes already switch to Intel for A18 process . Unfortunately AI is destroying the careers of college educated people. The irony is AI cannot replace trade school folks yet (eg electricians, plumbing etc)  If you went to college and your job could genuinely be replaced by AI then you were wasting your education . There's a grand canyon sized gap between medium blog experiments and actually doing anything commercially useful . The main people being replaced is maybe some low effort software engineering contractors if people can build their own scripting stuff for themselves . wait isn't the news good for AMD/NVDA saying that all demand is basically coming from 2 companies. APPLE might be the short of a lifetime lets short apple says the person who has never had an intelligent thought in their entire existence Low End Chip TSMC is a supplier of NVIDIA, they are the backbone across the industry What in the fk are you talking about? This is bad news because Nvda needs those chips from TSMC Anyone else think this might be a good entry to short NVDA How the hell did you reach that conclusion after reading this? Anyway, I've thought about shorting NVDA for weeks and every following week I'm happy I didn't?쁻 no, TSMC is saying that basically two companies are holding them up. Once AMD gets its mI300x out there = moon time bigger than NVDA as everyone calls it the new AI king Nah low AI demand is bullish for AI B-but muh AI? Todays the day to go a dogs mouth Txn charges on direct MFs Hi, so I am looking to stop my regular MF SIPs and move to direct. This also means I am changing investment platforms but the advisor from the current platform said that for direct plans, I'd still be paying transaction charges which is equivalent to the TER. Is that true? Any other drawbacks on direct plans? You have to pay TER which is the fund management expense on both plans. A direct plan will have a lower TER than a regular plan and consequently slightly higher NAV No drawback of direct. Go for it. U have to pay the TER but there will be difference and that difference goes to ur advisors pocket. But moving money has tax implications which u need to consider  Compare the TER of the regular and direct variants of the same funds and you'll understand . Both have the charges but regular has more to let the middle men take their cut . This is an unnecessary loss for you . For this reason alone I'd go for direct and consult a fee only advisor . There are no drawbacks don?셳 listen to advisors who have a vested interest. Go for direct mutual funds without further thought In Regular, you pay commission to agent + commission to the AMC. In Direct, you only pay commission to the AMC. Thus commission to AMC or total expense ratio (TER) is same for regular and direct schemes. But commission to agent is saved when you go for Direct schemes. This is about 2.5 to 3% annually. Means if your return in Regular scheme is 10% it would have been 12.5 to 13% had you gone for Direct scheme. Typically the gap in expense ratios of Direct and regular are capped by SEBI in most cases the difference between direct and regular plans are approx 0.50% - 0.75%. The no of 2%-3% are incorrect for accurate information you can check the monthly fact sheet of particular scheme. The value add and advisor brings is of different nature and ie financial planning asset allocation etc.Which more than compensates for the basic saving one tends to look at in direct vs regular. Happy to engage further. yes Absolute idiot. Don't listen to people like these. direct Mutual funds you will be paying 2.5% approx of the total CAPITAL as expense. Don't quote made up figures. The max ter allowed is 2.25% + 0.30% (in special cases). This would be for regular funds. Hence the ter for direct funds will be lower. The ter decreases as the funds size increases. 2.25% is for first 500 cr, next 250 is 2% and so on. So larger the fund, lower the ter. https://www.amfiindia.com/investor-corner/knowledge-center/Expense-Ratio.html",-10

Why you should never invest in INTC (Intel) Atom - Intel flounders industry leadership role and gets crushed by ARM processors for mobile applications. NAND - Intel had NAND fabs in china that weren't even being close to profitable and sold to SK Hynix after wasting billions down the drain. Optane - Micron Technology shut down Joint Venture 3DXPOINT leaving intel without their silicon. Altera -Intel purchased Altera the #2 fpga player for $17 billion vastly over paying and seeing no ROI. Intel no longer breaks their fpga business out in their earnings presentations. 4G/5G Modem - complete failure business abandoned Barefoot Networks - complete failure business abandoned Gross Margins - INTC 38.4$ AMD 53% AVGO 73% NVDA 67% Talent/Stock - If an engineer at intel got 200k in rsus after 4 years they would be worth $183,784. At nvidia 200k in rsus would be worth $2.1 million. Why would anyone want to work at intel? Capex: heavy cap ex requirements will keep pressure on margins Competition: Intel faces stiff completion from AMD and NVIDIA when it comes to CPU applications. They are also missing out as the large datacenter customers develop their own custom silicon.  GPU - shit show at first when intel rolled out their cards. So many bugs and just terrible performance but looks like driver issues are being addressed an they are already past AMD and closing in on NVIDIA . I'm not very bullish on their GPUs because they had over a decade of experience for iGPU . Mobile Eye: Probably intel's best decision in their 20 years as a company but they are so desperate for cash they are going to spin them off in an ipo Show me on the doll where INTC hurt you. Slowly points to floppy disk... points at wallet Probably OP used to own one of those early 2000s Celerons, and his buddy with the same price Sempron crushed him in benchmarks. The flaw of your argument is comparing INTC branded products to their competitors. The bull thesis is that INTC IDM 2.0 is a foundry play - they're going to be manufacturing all of the chips their current competitors design. Compare their business to TSM and you can see their potential. IFS has been made a matter of national security by the current administration. Source: massive INTC bag holder. Anyone who is interest in Intel, personally I have no position, should see the company as a turn around story. This video gives an amazing history and breakdown of what they are trying to accomplish. https://youtu.be/PtSSoZW19vs Thanks for sharing but when are you leaving Intel for Nvdia? What you are missing is that you are looking at the rear view. Tech companies need engineers at the top and NOT an MBA. Intel messed up because they had the wrong CEO. AMD and NVDA did not. Intel has since corrected that. Look at how MSFT responded with Nadella.  Intel provides a good risk to reward ratio at today's price compared to NVIDIA where all the optimism is baked in . Investing is always about balancing risk and reward . It does not mean that Intel will do well in future but they are taking correct decisions now . There was a time people thought AAPL was dead. There was a time people thought AMD was dead. Now some people think INTC is done. Keep in mind, INTC has massive resources. Its IR&D budget is larger than AMD's revenue. All it takes is a killer idea and a good execution to make it important again. The US government can't afford to let such an important player disappear. I am disappointed with the fact that INTC didn't open their GPUs to the VDI folks. When Nvidia Grid cards first hit the market, VDI was a free feature (later on that because a subscription service). If INTC opened up their GPU to VDI, I would have bought a few cards already. Good time to buy Intel, got it thanks",-2
2023-07-24,"Uniwechsel nach Bachelor  Auch die Bachelor  ich beabsichtige ab Oktober ein Studium an der Fernuni Hagen im Fach Psychologie aufzunehmen . Meine Frage lautet jetzt, ist dieser Wechsel ich amer noch versperrt? Ich bedanke mich f체r jede Antwort! Hast du den Studiengang entg체ltig nicht bestanden? Das w채re ggfls ein Hindernis. Wenn du nur kurz mal studiert hast, sollte es m철glich sein. Du wirst mit dem Bachelor der FU Hagen keinen Platz f체r einen KLIPP-Master bekommen. Den ben철tigst du allerdings mittlerweile wenn du die Therapeutenausbildung machen bzw. dir diese Option offenhalten m철chtest. Einem grunds채tzlichen Wechsel zu einer Pr채senzuni steht m.M.n aber nichts im Weg. Psychologie (/die potenziellen Masterstudieng채nge) bietet ja weitaus mehr als nur die Therapie :) Ok das hat mich schon mal beruhigt, ich dachte schon, dass auch der Weg zum Wirtschaftspsychologen mir versperrt bleibt, nach dem Bachelor-Abschluss in Hagen. Ist der Wechsel zum KLIPP-Master, denn auch nicht m철glich, wenn ich bereits klinische Psychologie Module belegt habe?",2
2023-07-25,"Anyone else feel like TSMC is spewing BS. I know a few people including myself, with plenty of experience that have applied for jobs with this company. Some immediately shot down due to asking for a comparable wage. Also looks like they just want more government funds and expansion of the Green card process so they can bring over cheaper labor. Instead of hiring from the local work force. So much for adding jobs to the area. I expect all corporations, both foreign and domestic, spew b.s about literally everything. It?셲 all about the money. Always. Don't apply with them directly is my suggestion. Most people on site don't work for TSMC directly. Apply with one of their contractors or an agency that recruits for them. I work there and that's how I got in. The pay is quite good in my opinion. ASML is the best IMO. They have a monopoly on the high end scanners and leverage over their customers.  H1-B visas will be the same as 1992, says John Sutter . Sutter used to enjoy reading ads from Texas for electrical engineers with requirements such as MSEE or even Ph.D. degrees . Funny how the solution is never paying people more, isn?셳 it? Every company spews BS. It's standard operating procedure. They just delayed the start of chip manufacturing by a year, which is not something a publicly-traded company would take, to admit so publicly, lightly. That said, I know a big requirement of their training/recruitment is 6-9 months spent in Taiwan, which for someone with a wife or kids, is a near impossible commitment. That might be part of their play though.  If they're asking for H1-B, it's likely to bring over their experienced employees from existing plants for the new chip manufacturing process . I know if I just spent billions on a new plant to produce the most advanced chips in human history, I'd want it staffed with experienced veterans . It's probably a bit of column A and a bit of column B. The training required is 1.5 years in Taiwan. They host you in a hotel/dorm type situation about 45 minutes from the training fab. No major public transport as it's more rural, but they offer a shuttle to and from the facility back to the housing... that runs only twice a day. 12 hours apart. Source: details from a friend who started the program then dropped out after 10 months My neighbor just moved from Utah because he was recuted by TSMC. Not 100% BS but you can almost guarantee a lot of new employees will be on a work visa. Friend of mine is training there this week. They?셱e being paid well and they?셱e really excited about it. So no, it?셲 not 100% BS, but I wouldn?셳 doubt there?셲 some poor budget/hiring choices being made somewhere. I'm an engineer that came in with less than 2 years of experience and I'm making 6 figures base pay, before bonuses. I know technicians with 1yr experience in the industry making $33/hr. That said, my experience only applies to working directly for TSMC; I don't know anything about the pay for construction contractors on the TSMC site. The lowest job I can find on Indeed right now is $24-$33/hour, and they're asking for a HS diploma, so this doesn't seem correct. TSMC pays insane wages. It's got an insanely toxic grind culture though. I work in STEM, and know the culture back in the east. TSMC can demand the amount of work and salary in Taiwan because they are the Google of Taiwan, the most prestige job you can get. Like your entire family gets all over you if you work for TSMC, like here if you work for Google or Goldman Sachs.  TSMC is used to demand special treatment from everyone in Taiwan because they were the #1 there, and refuse to realize they are now in the biggest market in the world and thus are playing in a totally different league . Local established Semi-conductor companies such as Intel, Microchips and others easily beats them both in job quality and pay I worked in immigration for 10 years and it?셲 crazy how many Americans are uneducated about this stuff. OP, you are incredibly ignorant lol. We don?셳 have enough engineers in the US so we have to hire foreign nationals to fill those roles. It?셲 a major problem. They?셱e projecting a shortage of about 6 million engineers in the US in 2024. I?셫 also assuming you don?셳 understand prevailing wages and how that process works. Me and my best friend graduated in Electrical Engineering from ASU and both applied there. We both have experience in semiconductor manufacturing from internships and research and haven?셳 heard dick from TSMC.",-2

Ich geb?셲 ihr weiter, mir kam das auch wie Unfug vor Frist setzen und ansonsten ab zum Anwalt. Bka aber das klingt alles sehr schwammig. Einfach dem Chef mal einen Ausdruck von den FAQs der Minijobzentrale auf den Tisch legen mit einer Notiz dabei, da횩 du die Nachzahlung binnen 5 Arbeitstagen erwartest. Ich wei횩 gar nicht, was manchen Arbeitgebern so im Kopf herumspukt. Bin kein Anwalt, habe aber selbst einen Minijob, seit Jahren. Daher kann ich sagen: 1 und 2 sind schwachsinnig. Nat체rlich kriegt man auch im Minijob Krankheitstage bezahlt (normal mit Krankenschein vom Arzt) und auch Urlaubstage. Ich musste noch nie Krankheits- oder Urlaubstage vor- oder nacharbeiten, damit ich die Tage gezahlt bekomme.

NVIDIA, renowned for its groundbreaking innovations in graphics processing units and AI technology, may face headwinds due to emerging trends in the AI sector .  JPMorgan's expert analysts have highlighted a few key factors that could potentially affect NVIDIA's performance in the coming months . One of the primary concerns raised is the intensified competition within the AI chip market . Moreover, the report underscores the significance of AI advancements in alternative technologies, such as neuromorphic computing and quantum computing, which could potentially disrupt traditional GPU-based AI processing. While NVIDIA has made significant strides in AI research and development, the emergence of alternative computing paradigms may pose challenges and uncertainties for the company's future prospects. Additionally, the AI industry is heavily reliant on data, and concerns over data privacy and security have been growing. Regulatory changes or increased scrutiny on data usage could impact NVIDIA's ability to access and process data, which is vital for the training and optimization of AI algorithms, thus affecting its competitive advantage. ""Ants may impact picnic."" Jpm reports are typically highlighting headwinds and tail winds not predicting the future.  JPMorgan's report contains a number of valid concerns that investors should take into account when considering NVIDIA as an investment . However, it is important to remember that the company has consistently been at the forefront of AI innovation and possesses a strong track record of success . So they are shorting or trying to lure more shorts in so they can pump it? Asking for a friend?

What you think about the future of this company? It's diversifying its business and hold nice indicator for its health, what about the price of this stock for the long term in your opinion? Ps: my average cost on that is 120. Here is my bear thesis. 1.) Their premium position due to the rapid expansion of the smartphone market is over. You can see this trend in their financials where looking 8 or so years back our book value is roughly on par with today's. So there is some erosion in their moat, but it's masked partially by the covid induced electronics mania.  Their return on equity and return on invested capital are roughly double each other - that means they using a lot of debt to pump their numbers . This trend began in 2018 . This is why I always read these boards. ""Their return on equity and return on invested capital are roughly double each other - that means they using a lot of debt to pump their numbers."" I didn't know this relation existed. Can you please expand on this, in general I mean, not specifically Qualcomm I'm not Nostradamus, but I imagine long term the market for small chips to do edge computing other electronics will vastly outweigh smartphone market. From appliances, AR/VR, manufacturing equipment, vehicles to robotics. An example of this taking place is EVs take twice as many chips as an ICE vehicle. These chips will do basic tasks like managing simple things to making inferences based on cameras and making split second decisions. The total addressable market is massive, much larger than most people I think. I don't know when we'll get there. I do think Qualcomm is poised to capitalize on this though. I don't have a position, but I definitely think it's an interesting choice right now. My concern is I just don't want to be 5 years too early. I was in it post earnings at 110 and rode it up to 128 pre-earnings and dumped it. I'm going to give it a 24 hr wait this round and see where it settles and find an entry point. I've got some napkin math to do this morning, but yes I'm looking to be long at some point through an options or shares. I'd like to see how much of their production is China dependent. This is the primary concern and why they are entering a value territory. NOTE: I sold some puts yesterday around 110 and 115. Today I reduced that position 50%. They are waving red flags for growth and supply issues... and yet the market can't stop buying. I'm taking my profits today and waiting for some reality to slap this tech sector into reality. Qualcomm revenue streams consist of: Licensing Chipset Sales Services their new snapdragon manufactured 4 nm by TSMC is very good. buy! Qualcomm is being punished during a very painful cyclical slump. To my mind, that is when you buy it. Jim Cramer said the report was a disaster, so its probably a buy. Personally I like the stock as a portfolio component. Qualcomm had previously bought Nuvia, some startup made up of Engineers that designed Apple?셲 M1 chip. However Apple only puts their chips in their own devices. If Qualcomm manages to produce a really good chip they might be able to expand into the Windows laptop and server markets, which could be huge. They?셪l be unveiling their new chip at some event in October, so I?셫 hoping the stock goes back up around then. Meh I don?셳 see huge earnings growth. I sold most of my position awhile ago. Still hold a tiny bit to follow but I see nothing that makes it particularly appealing. Would prefer multiple other semi plays or just the index instead. Just my opinion.",4

The demand for Android phones (the main market for Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip) is tanking. Not much they can do about it. If people start buying smartphones again, ta-da, problem solved. People having more money and less bank loans to pay would do that If you Google ""QCOM"" there's literally a bunch of new articles that explain it rather than predictions; bad earnings - Net income fell 52% year over year; handset chip sales declined 25% year over year. It went down. Poor guidance Apple making their own chips now. Qcom will bounce between 110-125 until it stabilizes. what is the chance to go back by Jan to $140 ? I'd say there's a 50/50 chance.

Its called the coming recession.. apparently phones go first now a days Excess inventory. Now cut excess employees non productive employees and benefits. Magico. Margins improve. Inventory management improves. Stock jumps. I used my in-house built tools and analyzed QCOM stock, here we go: 2023-08-10: The stock closed lower at 115.61 after opening at 117.68. 2023-08-09: The stock maintained stability, closing at 116.57. 2023-08-08: Closing at 117.66, the stock showed resilience. 2023-08-07: Despite a strong opening at 122.21, the stock closed lower at 119.34. 2023-08-04: The stock closed higher at 121.5, reflecting positive momentum. Recent market performance suggests a possible correlation with the news insights. The negative sentiment surrounding U.S. investment curbs on Chinese tech sectors seems to align with the dip in the stock price on August 10th. Conversely, the announcement of Qualcomm's collaboration with NXP might have contributed to the positive movement on August 4th. Opportunities: Development of RISC-V architecture opens new avenues in the automotive and IoT sectors. Diversification beyond China may mitigate some geopolitical risks. Risks: U.S. restrictions on investments in China could hinder growth and collaborations. Volatility in the market and regulatory uncertainties may impact stock performance. The current landscape for Qualcomm presents a mixed picture. While strategic collaborations such as the RISC-V project indicate innovative opportunities, geopolitical tensions and regulatory challenges pose considerable risks. Investors should remain vigilant to policy changes and market trends, balancing the potential for growth against the uncertainties that may affect Qualcomm's prospects. This analysis offers fresh insights and a professional overview of Qualcomm's position, empowering individual investors with a nuanced understanding of current developments and potential future trajectories.",0
2023-08-04,"Unpatchable AMD Chip Flaw Unlocks Paid Tesla Feature Upgrades What some call a bug others call a feature, all about perspective. ""Hacking the embedded car computer could allow users to unlock these features without paying,"" the TU Berlin researchers add. For example, 2021 Model 3 SR+ vehicles can enable the Cold Weather Feature (heated steering wheel, heated rear seats) for an extra $300. This feature unlock is confirmed to work with the exploit. Tesla Model Y Long Range owners can also pay $2,000 for Acceleration Boost, which decreases the 0-60 times of the vehicle from 4.8 seconds to just 4.2 seconds. Pricier options include Enhanced Autopilot, which costs $6,000, and Full Self-Driving, priced at an eye-searing $15,000. Honestly there needs to be a law against selling non working features on cars. If installed. Everything should work. Microtransactions for cars. The future Installing the parts but locking behind a paywall is a shit move. $2k for a 0.6 second head start. Pandora???box was never meant to hold all this shit. They??켩 going to start charging extra for AC and having windows that go up and down. Can it unlock more range? Some older Teslas have software locked range, yes. What's interesting to note about this flaw is that it is ""unpatchable,"" meaning that Tesla has no known mitigation solutions to counter it. Another consequence is that the exploit can ""extract an otherwise vehicle-unique hardware-bound RSA key used to authenticate and authorize a car in Tesla's internal service network."" What does that mean in English? Suppose a Tesla vehicle was totaled in a severe Teslas are among the most popular electric cars on the market, which makes them an easy target for hackers. Now, a team of security researchers from TU Berlin has found a way to exploit the MCU found in modern Tesla vehicles to unlock paid features and more. To execute the attack, the researchers exploited a known flaw in AMD's processor that controls Tesla's MCU. Ok soooo?? How does one do this? Asking for a friend Is there a guide on how to do this? For research purposes You wouldn???download a car. I definitely would if I could That is excellent news. So does it void the warranty or not? Welp, time to go buy the cheapest Tesla. The chip flaw is unpatchable. But they can do a software update that does a different verification I don???think this will last very long",-2
2023-08-07," Lawmakers urged to block TSMC worker visas over Arizona plant construction . Campaign is being waged against Apple chip partner TS So there?셲 an issue bringing 500 trained experienced TSMC employees over to help staff and train the 12,000 current US employees, so the plant can be opened and operational sooner? Every job has trainers, people who are more experienced with the machinery and processes in the business.  TSMC wants to bring in foreign workers so they can circumvent US regulations . The 12,000 employees they reference are the future staff of the plant . The current workers are independent engineering and construction contractors . Well I heard that tsmc was having trouble hiring locally because Americans didn't want to work like the Asia based workers since their work culture is brutal. So I imagine there's upset in bringing 500 foreigners instead of adapting to an American work culture It may be simplistic thinking, but I feel having a massive Intel plant out here kinda disproves any issue with not being able to find competent labor. I guess as others stated it's less competence and more, ""Don't view labor the same"" also based on the article. I live a few miles from this plant, last time I drove past I wouldn't know it was set to open in 2024 originally It?셲 not about competent labour, it?셲 about cheap labour. Before chips became a political issue this was the reason Apple designed their chips and had it made overseas.  As an Arizonan I have been speaking to people that have interviewed for TSMC because I applied as well as was very curious about the experience of others . I say no way! This company refuses to meet the standards of this state and are now wanting to bring employees to Arizona from Taiwan from Taiwan .  This company NEEDS to work with the laws here and hire locally! If they cannot abide by employment laws and wages of this state, they need to leave Arizona . They are not a charity. They are looking to make incredible profit while getting dirty cheap, underpaid and undervalued labor . Urged by who? This group: https://protectazworkers.org/ Who are in turn financed by this group: https://www.transparencyusa.org/az/committee/revitalize-arizona-201200625-pac?__cf_chl_tk=qKsR90PRDrAycBnYPG7QT2hW5deMkQcB7mgOpeV7Ook-1691464435-0-gaNycGzNDCU Who are further in turn funded by this group: https://www.transparencyusa.org/az/committee/residents-for-accountability-201200624-pac?__cf_chl_tk=qKsR90PRDrAycBnYPG7QT2hW5deMkQcB7mgOpeV7Ook-1691464435-0-gaNycGzNDCU Who are then financed by this group: https://www.transparencyusa.org/az/committee/arizona-pipe-trades-469-1227-pac?__cf_chl_tk=qKsR90PRDrAycBnYPG7QT2hW5deMkQcB7mgOpeV7Ook-1691464435-0-gaNycGzNDCU Who, finally (phew), are funded by these people: https://www.transparencyusa.org/az/committee/arizona-pipe-trades-469-1227-pac/contributors?__cf_chl_tk=qKsR90PRDrAycBnYPG7QT2hW5deMkQcB7mgOpeV7Ook-1691464435-0-gaNycGzNDCU My god, the rabbit hole goes deep.... Arizona GOP - ""Foreigners are taking our jobs!"" Also Arizona GOP - ""Hey, Foreigners, would you like some jobs?"" If anyone hasn't watched 'American Factory' on Netflix, do it now. It's incredibly pertinent to this situation. When we opened an office in Sweden, we sent 10 people out there to bootstrap it. They were UK citizens with families etc in the UK. Eventually after hiring rounds, some first workloads, some management in place etc, those people returned, i think a coupled stayed there. Who do the US intend to upskill from? Bingo! This is normal for any plant. You mean bringing over the guys who, you know, actually know how to make the chips? And who might, I?셫 just spitballin??here, know how to design and build a plant that might make the manufacturing of those chips easier? Those guys? that might make the manufacturing of those chips easier? Those guys? actually no, not those guys at all.
Mostly, they want to bring over technicians and blue-collar staff. They'd never send their researchers and top-contributors over. The words from some Chinese propaganda channels on YouTube I've seen last year is being proven true? Do the lawmakers realize that if Intel falls flat on its face, these TSMC workers from Taiwan might be the only ones who know how to run the EUV lithography machines from ASML? Except there is the knowledge base here just no one wants to get brutalized by TSMC managers. Their working environment is beyond toxic. No every machine from asml comes with its own operator/mechanic from asml it's apparently non negotiable. However the knowledge of setting up the rest of the plant around the machines is definitely something tsmc is very familiar with. how long does it take to build a factory? use that time to train workers. Even if this fab gets up and running, it would just be a matter of time before they're sued by the Department Of Labor. Apple buys every 3 nm chip that TSMC can make for next-gen iPhones and Macs Whoever wrote that article doesn't seem to understand how semiconductor manufacturing works. Apple didn't buy 3nm chips, they bought capacity. Ars Technica doesn't even get the timeframe right, because the source they reference states that Apple secured manufacturing through the first half of this year.  Apple is a huge pain in the ass to work with to the point that some vendors outright refuse to do so . TSMC, however, has all the leverage . Given Apple's obscene profit margins they can afford it . It's been widely reported that Apple is only paying for known good dies for 3nm. Apple has a long history with TSMC, and you can easily argue is directly responsible for their dominance over Intel. Apple also has a history of buying up the first allocations of new nodes from TSMC. This isn't their first rodeo together. Apple's obscene profit margins While I don't disagree with this statement, TSMC just laughs at Apple. Apple is reported to have a 43% gross profit margin, while TSMC is reported to have 54% gross profit margin. https://ycharts.com/companies/TSM/gross_profit_margin https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/gross_profit_margin M3 incoming ? M3 Mac Mini is in testing apparently What happens after 1nm ? For a while, process optimization coupled with 3D finfet designs that introduce nano sheets and nanowires, to get more from each transistor design. I highly recommend you watch Dr. Ian Cuttress' video on this, here: https://youtu.be/TwgvJSOa09M These chips aren't actually 3nm. We stopped using it as an actual distance measurement in chips many, many, years ago. It's now a marketing term, that's it. TSMC has had a lead over its competitors for a few years now, but that can change, and Apple could always threaten to go elsewhere if TSMC won't keep giving Apple favorable terms. Uhm.. who? 90% of the hype for the M1 was comparing intel's 14nm numbers to the latest and greatest 5nm node, and then circlejerking hard like they had made the holy grail. They weren't Circle jerking about the process as much as they were circle jerking about the architecture. Building a laptop with an ARM chip and a more modern instruction set compared to an x86 chip was the bigger deal. The jerk was well deserved IMO, because I legitimately haven't used a laptop that can be this powerful when pushed, but also get more than a full workday of battery life when using regular office productivity suite software. Kind of shows just how inefficient the x86 instruction set is, since they keep backwards compatibility for instructions that are rarely used. 100% of the hype paid off though. I work in the digital media field and the m architecture basically made it so either you own an apple product or you?셱e wasting a ton of money and time TSMC sure does have a lead over their competition but they'd be nowhere without ASML's EUV lithography systems. Well, Samsung Semiconductor is always an option and yet their nodes always seem to be a generation behind TSMC's. Although Apple relies on Samsung for most iPhone displays, having Samsung manufacture their chips as well means increasing their dependency on Samsung. I doubt Apple would want that. They should make the factories in PA. Some benefits of PA: Tons of workers looking to enter a future-proofed industry, good locations possible for rail delivery throughout Western, Central and Eastern PA, 2 large cities full of big brains as well. A important point: The water table will still exist in the next 10 years in PA due to geography and responsible and relatively rational use of our water resources (compared to say, West Virgina and Ohio). We?셪l be accepting refugees from states like Arizona and Texas in 15 years due to our overabundance of water. One of the big reasons they build them in Texas and Arizona is because those areas are seismically stable The DCNR says that the state?셲 most active seismic region is Southeastern Pennsylvania, saying that earthquakes of less than 4.7 on the Richter Scale have been felt in this area of the Commonwealth for at least 200 years. When your manufacturing at the 3 nanometer level even a small barely noticeable quake can fuck up an entire batch of chips The problem isn't location, it's workforce. https://fortune.com/2023/06/03/tsmc-arizona-plant-jobs-salary-culture-hiring/ 50-60 hour work weeks is normal for TSMC. Retaining a work force that will agree to that in PA is going to be very difficult. The only way TSMC agrees to a 40 hour work week is if PA cuts it a $10-20Bn tax break to offset the lost revenue from the loss of extra work force and man hours spent a the factory. 46% of the company, on Glassdoor or equivalent, worldwide, reported that the average work week is Monday to Saturday. Glad you didn?셳 mention New Mexico. At least here in Albuquerque our efforts at conservation and proper stewardship are causing our acquifer to rise, and we have a viable 100-year plan. That said, not everywhere in the state and region is so lucky. I like chips and gravy.. Report: Apple buys every 3 nm chip that TSMC can make for next-gen iPhones and Macs Okay, can any brilliant people out there tell me why those six squares weren?셳 filled in? It?셲 called wafer scribe - some less advanced wafers have dedicated squares for test structures. While others simply integrated into the cut line that divide the wafers and go away when being cut. This is because of all valuable space on the wafer must be used with minimal waste to save cost. Edit: I don?셳 think they break apart on that line. When wafers are done it?셲 visually very smooth. One will have to use a wafer saw (ceramic blade) go chop the individual dies off Turns out, you get what you pay for.  HP Touchpad was stillborn, on clearance almost as soon as it was released . WebOS was a pretty damned good os. I got two, and they served well for many years . To be fair, it is HP. It's a shock that they'd build with the seconds and not the fourths. Im sad WebOS died for mobile devices but it lives on in the LG TVs Here in Australia they launched on a Friday and then got discontinued on the Monday. I picked one up on the Monday for $150, down from the $600 it launched at 3 days earlier. It still wasn't worth it. The South Park episode where cartman got an HP Touchpad was great. So much so that my first iPad had ?쏧 asked for an HP Touchpad??engraved on it. Samsung did this to LG with the entire first batch of SD835s. LG's G6 used the previous year's SD821. Edit: LG took a lot of criticism for it while no one called out Samsung for being anti-competitive. What happens when we get to 1nm? Do we go to 0 next? 3nm is an arbitrary number with basically no relationship with the actual size of anything  The term ""3 nanometer"" has no relation to any actual physical feature (such as gate length, metal pitch or gate pitch) of transistors . A 3 nanometer node is expected to have a contacted gate pitch of 48 nanometers and a tightest metal pitch of 24 nanometers . Decimals has entered the chat We go to decimals. But for a real answer, we actually have a lot longer to go than the naming suggests. It?셲 been years since the name of the node actually matched the smallest transistor feature in size. The smallest feature in 3nm is actually 24nm. So why the 3nm name? Marketing. Nothing about these chips is 3nm other than their marketing name. Apple can't threaten to go elsewhere. There is no other company in the world that can make those chips. They don't need to, they just outbid everyone else, and they're the only ones that can afford to I predict an $899 price for the base iPhone 15 here in the US. If not, $849 or $829. EDIT: You know what? Let's annoy people and make it $859. These prices in the US are before tax, right? I always keep getting shocked about US prices compared to Europe before I remember the tax. Frankly, it?셲 a win-win situation for both of them. Apple is a stable customer and probably TSMC?셲 customer by far, and it?셲 not like anyone else can provide if Apple wants the absolute best. Samsung is the only other fab with a comparable process node, and it?셲 still a distant second. Probably, but we aren't part of any of the winning teams, so it is probably not great for us. Taiwan's TSMC to build semiconductor factory in Germany Good for the east. They now got Intel, Tesla and TSMC, among others. Hopefully makes that region more prosperous and more politically stable. The huge contrast between the cities and the rural areas is growing extremely fast. Dresden, Potsdam or Jena are some new powerhouses for the german economy. They belong to the fastest growing in terms of economy and population in all of Germany. And then there is the rural east... Yup! Poland is also getting an Intel factory. My only hope is that there finally will be physical PC hardware stores that don't require an online order. The last pandemic showed we cannot rely on online orders without being swarmed with bots and scalpers. Good for Taiwan too. Closer strategic economic ties with various European economic powerhouses will put them in better overall diplomatic standing with while EU Good for Taiwan too. Closer strategic economic ties with various European economic powerhouses will put them in better overall diplomatic standing with while EU Yes. now let's give them the courtesy of diplomatic recognition. First the factory of batteries announced earlier this year in France, and now this in Germany. Looks like Taiwan is making some moves in Europe. Good for us. Wow Germany is nailing it lately. Which is weird considering how many people here seemed to suggest that German Industry was somehow nearly dead. Great news. Germany is the European SC hub in the making. Good for Poland and Czechia especially aswell, close enough to the border to create jobs there too. Same with the Tesla plant, met a bunch of poles working there on the Warsaw-Berlin train a few times. Bigger population and near East europe borderwise Subsidies, more importantly however this area is one of the biggest hubs of microship industries in Europe already. So lots of local companies and expertise even if none is one of the big manufacturing players though several international big companies moved there over the years for the same reasons. Google Silicon Saxony if you want more info. You have the major interests push that industry for that region on political, educational and economic levels and also a history of the place having micro ship industries already under the Eastern Block. In essence one of the only industries that survived the Fall of the GDR in Saxony and thrives. Those two are seen as triage stations for the factory workers Taiwanischer Chipkonzern TSMC beschlie횩t Bau von Fabrik in Dresden Gro횩 wenn wahr Damit w채re Deutschland der vierte Standort von TSMC nach Taiwan, China und den USA Deutschland zieht die Bigplayer an. Erst kommt Tesla, dann Intel und jetzt noch TSMC. Grade f체r den 철stlichen Teil von Deutschland kann dies zu einem gro횩en Aufschwung werden. TSMC will in Dresden demnach vornehmlich Chips f체r die Automobilindustrie produzieren. Hoffentlich nicht nur f체r die Automobilindustrie. Wenn du auf Consumer Chips raus willst: diese Technologie kann nur in Taiwan produziert werden, das invest ist deutlich gr철횩er als das was hier angek체ndigt wurde. Hoffentlich kommen jetzt die bl체henden Landschaften (TM). Das w채re wirklich eine elegante L철sung sich den rechten Populisten zu entledigen. Der Osten ist halt absolut underrated von den wirtschaftlichen Faktoren. Sehr, sehr g체nstig (Personal + Infrastuktur) im Vergleich und sehr viel gute Talente, dank der Top Unis dort, die massenweise Zulauf haben. Kenne viele die in Dresden, Leipzig, Chemnitz etc. ihren Master machen, weil es die einzigen St채dte sind, die bezahlbar sind f체r nicht Reiche. Meine auch gelesen zu haben, dass die Unis dort am meisten Zuwachs haben aktuell. Und Dresden ist ja bereits der einzige wirkliche Halbleiter Hub, den wir in Europa haben mit Chip-Fabriken von Global Foundries, Bosch und Infineon und zus채tzlich dutzende von Zulieferern ist dort bereits Infrastruktur und Know-How vorhanden. Die Subventionen f체r TSMC wie auch f체r Intel in Magdeburg kommen 체brigens aus dem Klima- und Transformationsfonds (KTF, finanziert aus Emissionshandel und CO2-Abgaben). Begr체ndung ist anscheinend, dass die Chips f체r die Autoindustrie gebaut werden und diese dann wegen Elektroautos als klimafreundlich gelten. Aus dem KTF sollte eigentlich auch das Klimageld (Klimadividende) an die Bev철lkerung gezahlt werden. Davon h철rt man aber sehr wenig. Ist auch eine gute Investition. In einem normalen Verbrenner stecken schon um die 1400 microchips. F체r Elektroautos werden es noch mehr. Als w채hrend Corona die Lieferkette f체r Halbleiter zusammengebrochen ist, standen einige Anlagen in Europa f체r gewisse Zeit still. Halbleiter werden nicht ohne Grund als das neue 횜l der digitalen Welt bezeichnet. Strategisch sind diese Investition es definitiv wert. Bin mal gespannt ob die besser mit den Arbeitnehmerrechten hier zurecht kommen als in den USA. Mal sehen welche Kr철ten und Flederm채use auf einmal hier in Dresden auftauchen werden von denen noch niemand geh철rt hat. Mal wieder Zeit f체r eine Runde ""Sim Nimby"". https://opoulos.itch.io/simnimby Eine gro횩er gewinn f체r die Bundesregierung die netten Subvention springen l채ste, hoffe das dass nicht zerst철rt wie ander Projekte , 2010 hust hust Hoffen wir dresden macht daraus was und f채ngt gleich an auch bezahlbar Wohnung zu bauen. Mit Subvention lockt oder Schaft oder Schutze man indusrtie auch wenn dirses erst mal im - laufen. Aber die meisten wahler verstehen das vorsorge paradox nicht. Wei횩 man welche Strukturgr철횩e angepeilt wird? Die geplante Fabrik soll eine monatliche Fertigungskapazit채t von 40.000 sogenannten Wafern haben, die Chips in der Gr철횩enordnung von 22 bis 28 Nanometern und zw철lf bis sechzehn Nanometern enthalten Wohl nicht leading edge. Zum einen weil man in den Bereich Richtung Automotive will und zum anderen, weil leading edge in einem komplett neuen Land aufbauen sehr schwierig sein wird. Gerade was das Thema Luft und Wasser angeht w채re das unter komplett anderen Voraussetzungen eine gewaltige Aufgabe Es ist quasi alternativlos die Chipindustrie in die freie Welt zu holen. Auch wenn es erst mal nicht die Spitzentechnologie ist, w채chst das 횜kosystem der HL-Branche in Deutschland und dann ist alles m철glich. Und ja es kostet Geld und wird subventioniert, aber wenn China die Mauer wieder reaktiviert, w체rde es noch mehr kosten und garkein Know-How da sein. Und ja, die AFD ist im Osten stark. Aber angenommen sowas st철rt einen als Unternehmer, wo in Europa sind andere Verh채ltnisse? Quasi 체berall sind Rechtspopulisten auf dem Vormarsch, selbst in den USA und Japan. Wenn es also 체berall Mist ist, ist es quasi kein Standortnachteil mehr ... Und letztendlich sind solche Investitionen das beste Mittel gegen die Populisten. Es gibt keinen Fachkr채ftemangel nur einen Mangel an Leuten die nicht zu den geringen Geh채ltern arbeiten wollen. Wird hier doch in jedem Faden mit massig Upvotes wiederholt.",2

Only time i use the fridge is to eat, not play youtube videos on there Can it play skyrim? One of our lesson known projects is a water fabrication machine. Discovered originally by Berkeley students, Nodaria's blueprints contain a design for a tower that uses these to catch water vapor in the atmosphere to condense into drinkable water. Studies have shown this can draw a gallon or so water in a few hours to a day. We are still seeking if this technology works as well in reality vs on paper. We are also looking down the road. When cash is a greater availability. The research into geothermal energy so we can have limitless power. We've also also designed an energy grid off of Bricks using a new method of heat battery. We've already been making our own AI. And improving it along with making others are another project.

US TSMC plant faces calls to ban Taiwanese workers Construction companies don?셳 typically milk projects like this with so many eyes on it. If you look like at the details: Foreign company (culture differences/. language barriers) Niche factory TSMC desire for its preferred set up in Taiwan Difficulties hitting TSMCs preferred set up and all the Americans and their building regulations that differ from Taiwans building regulations. So many diffrence general contractors/Subcontractors to save money. You get a disaster that drags out beyond expected timelines. It adds up. Something similar happened with an auto-manufacturer that recently built a battery plant in the US south. The auto-manufacturer has a battery plant in Germany that produces battery?셲 for their electric cars and they hired an American construction company to build a second battery plant with the goal of having the exact specs as their german counterpart. Well the American company followed the specs to the letter from Germanys but they?셱e dealing with two severely limited production lines in the American plant because the ?쐔emporary??patchwork solutions that the Germany plant ran into to keep up with quotas didn?셳 translate well to the American plant. Now the auto-manufacturing company is stuck footing the bill for a battery plant that cant produce nearly as many batteries as the German plant and they can?셳 go along with the same patchwork solutions because of differing rules and regulations between Germany and the US, but they?셱e still expected to produce the same amount of batteries as the German plant. I think the US government should have a stronger hand in this situation if they really want to produce a steady supply chips for their national security needs on American soil. Situations like this where a foreign company wants to build their American facility to the same specs as their homelands facility should be taken seriously if they don?셳 want to incur unexpected issues on the production line. I worked as an engineer for co-op at the very plant you?셱e referring to - spot on analysis. Yeah I think it?셲 time for America to wake up and admit that our way is not always the best way and have a process to allow waivers if safety and environmental requirements are met. There is a great documentary on Netflix called American Factory that goes into the differences of culture that lead to these kinds of scenarios. Foreign nationals view America as a ""get it done / work hard"" culture and also pro big business, but they quickly learn that safety and planning work with subcontractors is immensely important for project schedules. Back when I sold European industrial equipment, we all realized to put a 2x -3x factor on estimated installation time due to things like safety, metric conversion, and overall construction design. The worst was in engineering structural loads. Not only do they use the metric system, their standards don't align with most of ours, let alone each state has their own methods.  In Asia, there is an abundance of labor which is therefore more competitive . Companies use that competition to put pressure on contractors . Detailed planning isn't as important when you can find a new contractor or sub on a moments notice . Split forming between geopolitics-focused liberals and worker-focused liberals. In terms of geopolitics, banning Taiwanese workers is incredibly stupid. In terms of protecting American worker interests, it makes sense. But protectionists don't make exceptions for geopolitical situations so here we are. How about economic growth and actually building a productive economy focused liberals We should do the opposite - attract as many TSMC employees as possible. It would reduce the risks to us if mainland takes the island by force, and would add to the US economic and tax base. Put differently, in the context of low US birth rates, why wouldn?셳 we want to attract lots of highly skilled workers from Taiwan? Which is hilarious cause 30-20 years ago it was the opposite; Americans setting up and managing the fabs in Taiwan and Asia. The US has that experience it's just with a bunch of wealthy retired boomers. The buildings that fabs sit in aren?셳 complicated to build, the instruments are. Plus, we do build fabs in the US. Intel built one in 2020, with another being built for 2024, in Arizona no less. This seems way more like TSMC isn?셳 used to be regulated in any way. We?셶e heard nothing but bad press about this project. Someone is leaking bad news to the press. Is it TSMC or someone else? I don?셳 know. When someone makes a comment about xenophobia, who are they referring to? The US construction industry? Or the super exclusive and uncooperative, totally not a sweat shop, taiwanese company?  The new Micron fab in Boise required extensive blasting to build down low enough for the sub fab . This blasting had to be coordinated with the existing fab / tools, and twice a day we had to coordinate a full shutdown of the fab as all the tools are extremely vibration sensitive . The tools are very sensitive and require a fully engineered pedestal system that isolated them from the earth and building those is much more complicated than building a normal skyscraper. TSMC isn't doing itself any favors with their PR, but they hired a mix of union and non union contractors so that started relations off badly with the unions. American companies work very gently with construction unions, and TSMC probably went in a lot rougher than they're used to. Intels fab 42 in Arizona which opened in 2020 was started in 2011 (with a multi-year delay in between), so it's not really a great testament to the speed of constructing fabs in Arizona. Comparing the fabs TSMC has with the one Intel have? Are you serious? Intel built one in 2020, with another being built for 2024, in Arizona no less. But their chips aren't as advanced. It might be that despite the push for ""supply chain sovereignty,"" it might just be easier to let Taiwan make the chips on their island and tell China to ""fuck around and find out."" Or the unions could recognize that their delays impact our national security. Union should expand to taiwan and make sure taiwanese workers get paid and have reasonable work hours as well. Rich bosses sitting on a sofa shouldn?셳 be paid that much. These unions are shit. If they can build the plant and meet TSMC specs, TSMC wouldn't need to send its workers from Taiwan. They can't. That's why the project has already been delayed. Just let TSMC send the workers they need, get that transfer of knowledge and tech and then send these workers homes once they've learned from them and taken all the necessary tech and knowledge. Stop being shortsighted and accept the pain for long term gain. Less jobs now but more jobs later OR more jobs now but less jobs later (when these fabs fail because they are being such dicks about it) Less jobs now but more jobs later More like less jobs now or no jobs later if China takes advantage of this delay to take Taiwan and put an end to America's dominance of the post-WW2 economic order These unions and local regulators are extremely shortsighted. ??They haven?셳 been able to fill positions, no? They're going to have to increase pay or relax the hours or go without DEY TUK ER JERBS! DURK N' DURRR! Umm, why would you ban the people setting up the factory for you to work in? I think we should ban nativists from having jobs In fact, I think you should need to be able to meet and go through the entire US Visa system if you sign a petition or letter like this Let them see what their barbarism feels like This article reeeeaally doesn't describe much of what's going on or do any analysis. It just states that: TSMC wants to bring in about 500 construction workers on an ""extraordinary ability visa (EB-2), and there is a burgeoning movement of an uncharacterized size, seeking congresspeople and senator's influence to push back on this visa issuance, because in the words of a union representative from Arizona, one of the main purposes of the bill authorizing the subsidies for the plant was to (trigger warning) protect American workers. I still don't know anything about the merits of either side. How many construction workers are in the Arizona market? What ""extraordinary skills"" is TSMC looking to bring in? Has TSMC actually been pushing to lower the safety standards for workers onsite? If we don't allow these 500 visas (which, now that I say it again, is an exceedingly small # of visas relative to the overall labor force), what are the implications for the security of the microchip supply chain? EB-2 visa can be for simply a masters degree, or a bachelors degree + 5yr experience (from here). But afaik, it's a permanent residence visa, aka green card. I'd have thought they'd wanna for for a short term visa like H1-B. Also EB-2 often has lead times of 2+ yrs now with the processing times involved. But H1-B also has a lottery thing, so immigration into America is gonna be a crapshow either way. Xenophobia combined with negatively impacting productivity, the worst things unions can offer all wrapped into one. People are so shortsighted and confused. The primary reason for the CHIPS act isn't to create jobs for Americans. It's so China doesn't send us to the dark ages when they take over Taiwan and force the rest of the world to beg them for chips. Jobs created are just a nice bonus. TSMC is the gold standard for semiconductor manufacturing. If you want the best, you're gonna have to play by their rules. Taiwan has a wealth of semiconductor knowledge that we don't have in the US. I've heard that TSMC sees the AZ plant as a place that will need a ton of babysiting and input from Taiwanese expertise for quite some time before it can actually stand on its own. Please, xenophobes, just give the US a chance I'm personally not down with the xenophobe comment as it relates to the local workforce - if anything, TSMC is the one insisting the only way to get the fab off the ground is by relying on their superior natives instead of doing their homework and figuring out how to be a competitive employer locally.  TSMC is so distrustful of the local labor force that they are requiring some roles to relocate to Taiwan for 6-12 months for on the ground training, and offering below market rates for the privilege . Asking a highly skilled senior electrician to leave their family and relocate to another country for a year is never going to work . TSMC is also very famous for forcing all of their workers to work very long hours for low pay. They?셶e convinced Taiwanese that working for TSMC is your national duty so they?셱e able to pay their engineers far below market rate. Not saying they?셱e abusing labor here since I have no idea but I wouldn?셳 be surprised based on their history. The anti-immigrant idiocy unleashed by Trump will be this country's undoing. It existed long before Trump, he was just the culmination of it.  TMSC gets massive subsidities, says it will bring jobs, but its a job that expects you to work very long hours, in a completely different culture that treats their workers worse . You just call them xenophobes and wonder what happened to blue collar dems . It's almost like paying Taiwanese corporations to build factories in the US is a bad idea that the last administration already tried with disastrous results Thank you! This is a ridiculous conversation. Nothing about this is xenophobia - its an employer the state welcomed with open arms (and funds) who is now looking to import all the jobs it promised to create locally.  Senior tradespeople with 10+ years of experience being offered $27-30/hour on the condition they relocate to Taiwan for 6-12 months first . It's ridiculous - my company's recruiter has never seen TSMC at any of the recruiting events she goes to . Industrial policy not producing the results you expected, leading instead to market distortions and unexpected negative outcomes? Who could have predicted this?  TSMC wants to bring in construction crew from Taiwan who already has experience in completing jobs as specified by TSMC . My take is that the American crew wants to milk this project as much as possible, they don??�� care if they are behind schedule because it?ÂÂ³ . Likely major culture differences here too. TSMC doesn?셳 mess around probably rubs the Americans the wrong way and messes with their norms. Not too sure about the milking part though. Construction industry is well known for milking anything if you let them, government or not but there are a lot of eyes on this project may not be the case. Except in Japan, TSMC is chugging along nicely. Started a year later than the USA but was going to beat the USA by a year. The Japanese are sticklers for safety, much more so than the USA. ok, this is my final hot take and i don't see myself changing unless you have goddamn good reasoning.  US Govt - just wants semiconductor capability in the USA . US workers - don't care at all, sees this as just creating jobs that should belong to americans .TSMC - just . wants to make profit within legal means . aka, find me a corporation that isn't.that isn't . insurance against China . basically, these 3 parties didn't work out how this venture would be possible without compromises. From my understanding of discussions with family who work in/for TSMC. There was internal dialogue, not about if the US venture would be successful, but rather WHEN it would fail.  There's still huge misconception about the semiconductor fab business in that it's a huge upfront cost, of which once a factory is completed, it's pretty much already out of date . This along with the fact that there's razor thin margins on semi-conductors in the first place, is what's leading the thought that the US being a The US plants are a move to placate some political US/Taiwan relationship undertones, but make no mistake, all of the most important chips will still have to be made in Taiwan (or somewhere else) where speed, at the cost of everything else, can take precedent.  I?셬 working on a deal for a property in the US. Buyers requested an up to date structural inspection. My partner and I were talking about it and joking that this will take at LEAST a few weeks if not longer.  In TW I was in quarantine, having trouble ordering a PS5 online. Some dude from Reddit went to Costco and bought it for me and delivered it to me SAME DAY I made a post on here about it lol. Working in the US you get used to things like this. Permitting can take months or years. Things are always delayed It really is different. Asians always talk about how Americans are slow. Our usual retort is, well at least were not European. Lol, good luck with that, America. We thought you wanted this to work. This is construction work, not fab work. Some things to keep in mind. Keep seeing a few site being sited. Site like prospect has a very pro-union bias, so you should question is the article really only about criticizing labor practices and not care about the technical requirements and the business requirements of building a fab. These writers don't care if the fab is successful or not.  The chip manufacturers don't make their own tools, those have to be bought . Many tools need floor reinforcements and become semi-embedded into room when installation is complete . Building a fab is very sensitive to time and money .  The contractor has to bid and sign contracts for the job, if they are not delivering, it is the contractor at fault . Intel is also building a fab across town, if Arizona can't come up with the results then out of state labor and specialized company labor should take those jobs . TSMC is not required to pay for anyone's learning experience  The semi industry is very competitive, you should want your tax dollars to do the most winning, not the most union member suckling at the teat . I am sure many of you have experienced American bureaucracy and union milking a job . Would be funny if it actually happens, and the plant stops to progress from its current state, and then they end up buying out the plant from tsmc and the plant just swindles and dies To me this whole thing reads as US contractor not used to being told what to do. TSMC doesn?셳 mess around and put up with union milking strategies. The hardest to believe is the safety claims. What does bringing Taiwanese have to do with safety? It?셲 still in the US and OSHA rules apply. They don't want to work as hard, so they want to ban hard workers... This is why TSMC ought to focus in Taiwan. Honestly, they should've seen this coming. I mean, even I did (and was boasting about it then). I mentioned extensively why Taiwan can't be replaced in terms of semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. That is a very hot take... do you know people working in the semiconductor industry? It's not exactly a place where there are is anyone not working hard.  Even amongst American companies, you are pretty much working 100% of the time during your work hours without any time to pause and rest your mind . Burnout is a huge problem, and the brightest are pivoting to tech instead .  Anyone working in construction is most definitely working their ass off . This is in Arizona where the daytime temperatures regularly exceed 45 C, and the inside is probably getting in the 40s . They don't want to work as hard, so they want to ban hard workers... Honestly, they should've seen this coming. I mean, even I did (and was boasting about it then). I mentioned extensively why Taiwan can't be replaced in terms of semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Did you even read the article? This isn't about the workers who will actually be manning the factory. It's about construction workers. You can raise questions about the ability of Americans to compete in semiconductor manufacturing. But construction? Sorry, I think comments like these are probably closer to the real explanation of what's going on here: https://www.openweb.com/share/2TjAIFRTsrxi4bcdGvne0rRDYkN https://www.openweb.com/share/2TjAKmiLFgAnIaJFlKZnx5QC0m7 For more information: https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/23/tsmc-arizona-plant-safety/ https://prospect.org/labor/2023-06-22-tsmc-semiconductor-factory-phoenix-accidents/ https://fagenwasanni.com/news/workplace-safety-measures-enhanced-at-tsmc-construction-project-in-arizona/114744/ It sounds like TSMC isn't quite used to operating in a place where it can't do whatever it wants just because it's TSMC. This is why TSMC ought to focus in Taiwan. Very few companies as big and as important as TSMC have such a geographically limited footprint. For better or worse, like it or not, the writing is on the wall: the world isn't comfortable with all of TSMC's eggs being in one basket whether that's been done for business reasons or in an attempt to create a ""silicon shield"". Agreed. As someone on the inside, i called this whole thing out for the shit show i knew it would be. Its gonna screw up their whole company in terms of workplace culture, employee moral, and employee compensation even back in Taiwan. Puts on TSMC. Chips manufacturing in Taiwan = US interest to protect Taiwan so as to protect its own economy Chips manufacturing in US = US interest for war between Taiwan and China so as to destroy China's economy and reputation. Taiwan government needs to ban TSMC manufacturing in other countries. LOL. Pathetic. No Taiwanese worker no tsmc. F u there is talk of US-made chips costing more than those made in Taiwan. Why is this a shock to anyone that it's cheaper to manufacture in Asia than in America? TSMC has a terrible work culture and requires new recruits to go Taiwan for 12-18 months for training. Pretty tough sell for talented American engineers with options here. It definitely appears they have been making it extremely difficult for local people to want the jobs so that they can make the claim for work visas and bring in Taiwanese workers. It's not just about engineers they are replacing American construction workers with their workers. Seen a Taiwanese welder on that job 20 feet in the air with no fall protection on, wearing shorts. They don't take breaks or lunch, piss in water bottles and leave them everywhere. Ya pretty much bs, AZ workers have set up fabs for Intel. This is just a case of TSMC wanting to spend less and work those who will come on visas to the bone. Taiwanese bosses are frustrated that Americans aren?셳 willing to work 996 (9am-9pm, 6 days a week). I know this because I was just talking to a guy here from Taiwan who is working there. Exactly. The Valley is a hotbed of tech talent. I was a field engineer for Applied Materials where I have installed many, many tools and this whole thing is a joke. Image I took yesterday of massive plant under construction Worker shortage is bullshit. Every union hall has filled every work call TSMC has put out. Worker skill is bullshit. On Semiconductor, Intels largest site in the world, Free scale, AMAT, ASM, Tempe Microchip all in Arizona. Tons of people here travel to Ireland and Israel to help build Intel factories because of the knowledge we have here. Arizona Union workers were a huge work force at the chip plants in Utah and New York. Lol they won?셳. This was the plan from the beginning. Doug Ducey sold Arizona out every chance he got. https://twitter.com/kevinsxu/status/1689639343621877760?t=MRCgOwZO_9SkrSdBbTHnew&s=19 Some trolls trying to hype up the idea that the whole plan will fall apart on a Twitter thread. From one user TSMC should consider to cut loss and go. The longer this drags on, the larger the loss. Even if this plant is built up in time, its overall efficiency and cost structure will result in much lower profitability than other plants. This will be Joe Biden's ""Solyndra"" unfortunately. I predict the plant will never successfully (profitably) produce semiconductors. Too many benefit from it failing including the Chinese, the unions, Intel, and the ""We told you so!"" TMSC founder himself. A fab is a horrible place to conduct a culture war. One under construction even more so. Can't have leaky welds in mission-critical double-wall tubing carrying poisonous gasses, buried under concrete and behind all sorts of other virtually immovable equipment (photolithography machine) etc. It's impossible to repair. I speak as a former Motorola Semiconductor engineer. Short the stock! All you have to do to see what is really happening here is watch the Netflix documentary ""American Factory"". That tells the whole story, its the same bullshit with chips as it is the the auto glass business or any foreign owned company setting up shop here. American workers just don?셳 have the experience and technical capabilities in this field Who do you think has been building and expanding fabs in Phoenix for the past 60+ years? Phoenix has been a semiconductor area since the industry started, before it even moved to Asia. The company got massive tax incentives because they were going to be employing thousands of Arizonans.. American workers do have the experience and capabilities, they just aren?셳 willing to work for unethically low wages and terrible work standards. TSMC needs to up their pay and lower the expectation of 60 hour weeks, or fuck right off. They want Taiwanese workers because they will work 14 hour days 7 days a week at half the rate the contractors are getting now. That's a hard no pretty sure in order to get a tax break and the land TSMC agreed to use us workers.",2

2023-08-10," President Joe Biden has signed a new Executive Order banning US investment in Chinese tech . This is a significant escalation in the President Joe Biden has signed a new Executive Order banning US investment in Chinese Tech ??This is a significant escalation in the U.S.-China tech war. The executive order restricts US venture capital and private equity investment in high-tech Chinese industries, including quantum computing, semiconductors, and artificial intelligence. The order aims to protect national security by limiting the transfer of American expertise that could aid China's tech development. China has retaliated against U.S. sanctions by banning its companies from buying products from American memory chip maker Micron Technology and setting export restrictions on minerals critical to making semiconductors and solar panels. Yttrium is a rare-earth element that is used in the production of semiconductors and magnets. Gallium is a metal that is used in the production of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells. The U.S.-China tech war is likely to escalate. Good, now do foreign investment and corporate investment in residential housing Residential housing, commercial properties, farmland, etc. Removing China from US real estate opens a floodgate of supply to a barren demand side??that will make all the big investors and politicians lose on their real estate holdings. Never going to happen. is this willful ignorance? Most of the buyers are US institutions and funds like black rock. Wealthy Chinese/Indian/arabs buy up luxury properties as stores of value, not rent-gouging on affordable entry level housing. At most they have equity stakes in US funds that do this, but even our retirement accounts here do. If you own a share of an REIT you are guilty. Most pension funds own some too, most Americans are guilty and they don?셳 even know it! Just wondering, how do we get around procuring Gallium and other critical elements? Space x to Mars and other planets So what happens to my stocks? The US seems a bit desperate to maintain its rapidly-waning technological edge. Germany approves $11 billion TSMC chip factory Interesting they chose Germany, since so many middle class companies now moving to other European countries for cheaper electricity, but Germany is the global transit hub of Europe, can be helpful. Germany is by far the biggest industry nation in Europe. I would suspect they will built chips mostly for the car industry that is heavily in need of them.  South Korea is eaqually dependent on LNG gas than Germany now . Germany had a shakeup due to loosing the Russian gas . But I wouldn't say electricity is bound to be much more experience than everywhere else . Germany just has to get to the point to phase out coal and use gas mostly for the Delta and it could be very price competitive very soon??People kinda forget France had their nuclear almost entirely fail in the last year getting mostly compensated by Germany (while being blackmailed by Putin) I don?셳 think the momentary situation is representative of the coming years. Finally, cutting edge processors for fax machines in every government office! /s Cool! Good news! Now show me where you?셱e going to get the qualified people to run your new plant. Same all over the world right now TSMC US chip plant battle deteriorates, with US workers insulted ?쏛 popular Taiwanese YouTube account has accused Americans of being lazy?? Lmao. I wonder if this is actually laziness, or just the Taiwanese workers not realising that the work culture is just so much different in comparison? The documentary called American factory is really insightful. Based on that story?? Ya, it?셲 kinda laziness mixed with a less rigid/strict culture. There's literally pictures of construction worker sitting on equipment playing on his phone. That sounds insane to the Taiwanese, not just sitting on equipments, but posting a photo of sensitive material as well as playing with their phone on the job. I?셶e worked in US semiconductor fabs to know semi fabs are not going to be economic in this country. Especially high precision and high requirement ones I'll give you my real life example. I worked for a US semicon manufacturer back in 2007 based in Texas. They had 3 US based fabs and 2 in Asia (SK and Japan). The US fabs were yielding around mid 60%, the Asian ones were between 85-95%. The US fab workers were: a) manufacturing one tech node behind their Asian counterparts (meaning, a mature process at that point) b) using machines that were already tuned by their more experienced Asian counterparts c) paid more than their Asian counterparts. The yields were regardless of product lines, meaning chip design was not the issue. Needless to say, post GFC, all 3 US plants shut down. Meanwhile?쪮ermany just gets on and builds a factory.  Americans have been screwed over by every employer, it?Â�� hard for them to work in a bleeding edge factory . Workers need to care about the process because the tolerances are so thin . This isn?�� an ice cream factory. You also can?ÂÂ™ clock out right at 5 just because your contract tells you too ...This isn't even talking about operating the fab, just building it. You also can?셳 clock out right at 5 just because your contract tells you too. This isn?셳 an ice cream factory. The solution is simple then. Pay people not to clock out right at 5. This isn't an ice cream factory, you need to pay for skilled people to work for you. I saw this movie. It was called Gung Ho. Who cares if the US workers feel dissed. Just put on your big boy pants and get the f*cking plant built. Plants get built by people. Workers, some might call them TSMC decides to build a factory in Germany  The Tesla plant was only meant as a 'Fuck you' from Musk against German car manufracturers . Brandenburg only won due to a higher amount of subsidies . Germany is also paying around 21 billion in subsidies for the Intel and TSMC plants. The former GDR nations are Germany's more underdeveloped federal states and subsequently received these plant with that motivation and due to location factors. So if Polish workers move or communte to Germany, then it's more or less an unintentional consequence of better labour laws. What am I reading? Seems like pis propaganda is pretty strong over there. Even when we're deciding to build factories in our country its somehow an attack on Poland.

2023-08-14,"Intel CEO Says It Should Get More CHIPS Act Money Than TSMC, Samsung  I'd agree with Intel getting more CHIPS money, but only if they spin off IFS and the design portion of Intel is completely separate from IFS . If Intel wants to use IFS' nodes, they gotta pay just like everyone else . That?셲 how it works. Intercompany service charges and transfer pricing is how this stuff works from an internal operations and financial reporting standpoint. Intel what a scummy company begging for subsidies. Would they fab for AMD? Ask them that before giving them more money. Intel would if they're actually serious about wanting IFS be an industry leader. Even if AMD only manufacture secondary components on Intel's fabs, like chipsets and memory controllers, that's still a major contract win and shifts the revenue balance away from rival foundries. To be fair, Intel is a publicly traded company and it would be against shareholder interest to not petition for increased subsidies. Whether it's ethical or not is a totally valid argument, but to say Intel shouldn't be seeking literal free money isn't a great argument against it. People miss the entire point of this stimulus. Currently, the US is relying on a foreign country for advanced chip making capabilities, and it's a national security risk. Subsidising cutting edge chip manufacturing locally makes sense, and it's a pittance compared to spending in other areas yet it's one that's extremely important. On top of that, you are training and retaining engineering talent and boosting local supply chains, so what the government spends, they can usually get back via increased economic stimulus and the resulting tax paid. Also, if something happens in Taiwan then we know the world is probably screwed, but the US trying to mitigate the risks somewhat is a logical thing to do. I'm no fan of corporate handouts, or corporations in general, but I don't see a huge issue with this. It's not like the US is subsidising something that no one wants, like for example, capsicum. Would they fab for AMD? Ask them that before giving them more money. Of course they would, lol. The question you should be asking is if AMD would let Intel fab for them Of course they would fab for AMD. Corporations make stuff for their competitors all the time. It's just money, they pay each other and get services and goods in return. No they shouldn't. TSMC has no conflict of interest with its customers and it's the ""world's fab"". If anything TSMC should get more incentive to move on shore. Not to mention they are the most advanced fab which makes the best chips. So if you want the best chips on shore, TSMC is it. TSMC is not going to move their most advanced nodes to the US so not sure why that even matters Personally I think I should get pretty big CHIPS act grants, given that my consumption of potato chips probably single-handedly keeps a third of the industry alive No, the preacher Pat is a scam. Most of Intel's foundry capacity is based in the US. Only about a quarter of it is located outside, in Ireland and Israel. What do you mean they moved offshore? Most Intel fabs are located in the US and the ones that aren't are located in US ally states like Israel and Germany. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_manufacturing_sites",0
2023-08-15,"Chinas largest real estate four times larger than Evergrande bankruptcy crisis warns of chain collapse  I dont have much to eat today so Im coming in Shall we take a look HW News  Linus Tech Tips Terrible Response ESMC  Starfield x AMD GPUs One line in the statement thats also really dumb is To my team  I stressed the importance of diligence in our work See you can stress the importance of diligence all you want If you then dont give them the time to actually be diligent because youre making them crank out 25 videos a week which is exactly what his employees said in that interview video then it doesnt matter what you tell them Youre not gonna get any diligence Its as if some Apple CEO walked into one of those Chinese sweatshops and told the workers there about the importance of synergy and worklife balance but then still expects them to work 120 hours per week Its just empty words The whole Im just one of you guys im an employee too gets old really quick Putting himself in his own Interviewing our employees video was insane
He seriously believes that Linus from LinusMediaGroup and LinusTechTips is just a regular employee We could have retested with perfect accuracy but to do so would have been impossible We didnt sell it we auctioned it How tf are these the words of an actual person Oh shit man i expect linus to double down but not this hard like people were ranting at GN for not contacting Linus before and saying linus already had an agreement with Billet before the video and yet it wasnt the agreement only exist because of thag video I also agreed witb GN contacting LTT before would make it easier for them to twist the truth now they are caught red handed like cmon linus stop and think for a second claim to your own mistake make a video about it and move on not doublingdown like this Linus should let Billet Labs give a proper quote Not just pay them the  amount they initially mentioned bullshit  tech jesus 2023 1043 Coming thirty seconds after calling out gaslighting by name Tech Jesus is not to be fucked with Also what deserves a highlight is Linus saying that GN did a poor job as journalists for not contacting him The guy that put a video in which he used the product in the way it wasnt intended ignored the instructions sent by the company AND even ADMITTED that all his data was wrong but doubled down on it and said that he wouldnt retest it Is talking about journalism integrity Wow Just wow Steve with the steel chair from the top rope bah gawd that media group had a famly Hello there a quick reminder to everybody before commenting we dont allow being unpolite uncostructive being offensive towards LTT group Linus Steve Hardware Unboxed or any other person or group Even if you think that what Linus or LTT did was really bad this doesnt give you any right to call them names to verbally abuse them to advocate brigading towards their channels or to advocate for violence yes today I saw one comment crossing also that line Keep it constructive and keep it polite otherwise its a ban EDIT phrasing Linus really really should have taken a day to form a proper response to this whole matter One that was constructed with more people involved going through it with him Some of them preferably being PR people In the meantime maybe put out a short statement that you are aware of the issues raised and will adress them soon Instead he just went in red hot just a few hours after the GN video on a rant on his forum and made himself look an even bigger ass I knew Linus response was shitty and he completely ignored all the ethics issues and demonstrations of testing errors but holy I didnt know he actually outright lied about the Billet Labs compensation part From all weve learned it seems very possible LTT would never have compensated Billet Labs for screwing them over if GN hadnt shined a public light on the issue Cool so Linus lied once again lol EDIT Statement from Billet Labs EDIT2 Former LMG employee Madison coming out with allegations about toxic workplace culture including sexual harassment Link to Madisons older Glassdoor review for a more readable summary of issues she faced This really stood out from the video for me and keep in mind this is directly from Billet Labs with whom GN has communicated directly They have not received nor agreed upon any compensation from LMG Direct contradiction of what Linus claimed Only discussion about moneycompensation so far was them telling LMG This was a REDACTED waterblock after finding out they had sold achtually auctioned their prototype LMG had been completely ghosting them before the GN video went live I genuinely didnt think this PR shitstorm could get any worse for LMG but that last point proves that I was wrong Another revelation in the emails is apparently Billet Labs sent them a 3090 Ti to test yet somehow LMG didnt have one and tested it on a 4090 This must have been an inventory mismanagement disaster from start to finish Direct link to part of the video where emails from LMG mentions that theyll send back the waterblock and the 3090 Ti in each of their emails to Billet Im so glad he used the term gaslighting It was Linus played the victim here and felt attacked he has gone after companies that behave in the same way in the past Chickens coming home to roost The worse part here IMO is that Linus gaslighted a person he used to regard as friend Lets not forget when LTT hack happened the person who kept calling Linus nonstop to alert him about it was Steve Another LTT controversy and another stubborn Linus response that refuses to take any responsibility or even address most of the concerns brought to him I love a lot of LTTs content Ive been watching them for years and theyve done a ton of important stuff but Linus does this shit SO much its honestly incredibly frustrating The only thing shocking here is that it wasnt a 45 minute wan show segment of him shitting on everyone who dares criticize him Hes done this like a dozen times at this point He or LTT fucks up people call them out they halfass some response Linus goes on wan show and shits on everyone and clearly isnt sorry never brings it up again I think the most damning part of this and there are a lot of things that have gone wrong here is him acting like properly reviewing the monoblock from Billet Labs was somehow beneath him Supposedly his company has invested a lot of money into their labs and test equipment so they can do more in depth and technical analysis None of that is worth anything if youre willfully putting out bad data NVDA 27000 PUTS Ball position or ban A moment of

2023-08-16,"$INTC Intel's $5.4 billion acquisition of $TSEM Tower Semiconductor called off due to lack of Chinese regulatory approval Surprised there wasn't a post on this? This is pretty big news for the chip sector imho. https://www.techspot.com/news/99807-intel-54-billion-acquisition-tower-semiconductor-called-off.html https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/16/intel-scraps-5point4-billion-acquisition-of-tower-semiconductor.html Intel on Wednesday terminated its acquisition of Israeli chipmaker Tower Semiconductor, saying it failed to get the required regulatory approval. The U.S. chip giant will pay a termination fee of $353 million to Tower. Intel announced plans to buy Tower in February 2022 for $5.4 billion. Tower is a contract chipmaker that manufactures semiconductors for other companies. I think this is a huge win for intel, A) they have 5.4 bill cash now to invest in whatever B) tsem is even cheaper if they want to buy in future instead of the 54 a share premium that was demanded This. Simple and plain explanation. 5.1 bil after termination fee China won't approve it. TSEM won't sell for current price. China did the same thing to Qualcomm when they tried to buy NXP. Exactly, and nxpi still more than doubled since then even though share price dropped after the cancellation of the deal TSEM is still inherently a good company (good liquidity, cash flow and very low debt) and that?셲 why intel wanted to pay more than $5B. And it had to cancel not because they figured it was a bad investment, rather it was due to factors that they did not have control over. And now on top every thing TSEM had going on, they have a good chunk of free money ($350M - 1/10th of their market cap) that will help with CF. Another company might want to buy them again but even if they dont it will continue to grow even by itself. This was just an excuse for Pat to get out of this deal. Good move on his part. I think Tower was just a rebound after Nvidia initially announced plans to try and buy ARM a few years ago. I am in at this point, I dont see much downside from here??even as a company by itself It was priced even more than current price 18 months ago before this acquisition was announced. On top of everything, they got $353M of free money for the cancellation.  Intc was ready to buy it for $54/share before market went higher by 20-30% and now this is priced at below $30 . Now that the deal is off they will be able to issue forcasts and that should shed more light to its current ridiculous price . INTC is the one who has to pay the cancellation fee to Tower Fitch warns of Dozens of US banks including JP Morgan at risk of mass credit ratings downgrade An analyst at Fitch Ratings an international credit rating agency said dozens of US banks including JP Morgan Chase are likely to be downgraded in droves
In an exclusive interview with CNBC on the 15th local time Chris Wolf a banking analyst at Fitch warned that the US banks Operating Environment OE rating could be further downgraded from AA to A warning This will lead to a fullscale reevaluation of more than 70 US banks
A downgrade in the credit ratings of big banks like JP Morgan would at least have to consider downgrading all of their peers warning some vulnerable banks could see their investment ratings fall to ineligible levels
Earlier on the 7th Moodys downgraded the credit ratings of 10 small and mediumsized banks and warned that 17 lenders including large banks such as Truist could be further cut CNBC I hate holidays now On holidays the market rose significantly pretending to be in a good mood but US stocks fell at the end of the holiday so the stock market did not go up but rather fell more than the previous trading day It should be a pattern or two that continues to be a hope advisor Public holiday beauty rebound is not working anymore Stock market booming today You come and go right away",-2
2023-08-17,"Sell NVDA NVDA?셲 bubble will burst come earnings report on 8/23 for the following reasons: The bar is too high. Analysts consensus is earnings of $2.07 per share almost double it?셲 Q1 earnings of $1.09. The last 2 reports showed an average increase q over q of 18.5%. Too big of a leap. TSMC their leading manufacturer hasn?셳 shown any evidence that they are kicking out new AI chips. Their earnings have been flat. So where?셲 the new money coming from for these high priced NVDA AI chips? The jury is out regarding the direction of AI. Bing hasn?셳 made a dent with ChatGBT with regard to stealing market share from Google. New horizons are not well defined. NVDA still relies on revenue for conventional gaming chips for PC?셲 and crypto mining. Both these areas are fading. There is still competition out there for the AI chip market. I like AMD with their APU (accelerated processing unit) chips combining both CPU and GPU in one. I believe they will advance in this area. Bottom line: I believe NVDA forward P/E of 58 should be closer to 38. Fair value $284. TL;DR: The bar is too high for NVDA's upcoming earnings report. They are up against tough competition, and their main revenue sources are fading. I believe their stock is overvalued and they will not meet expectations. This is the only DD I trust. I want to be able to afford puts. I been killing it with SOXL puts. It moves just like nvda but for a fraction of the premium There are actual reports that nvidia's AI chips are already sold out through spring 2024. TSMC fab capacity was booked and paid for a year ago. Their leading edge nodes are booked solid and they can't add fab capacity that quickly so their profits are the wrong place to check for clues. AMD will compete but not right now. They're 2 years behind nvidia on the AI front. They have decent hardware, their software is where they're weakest. Nvidia is making tens of thousands of dollars per H100, A100, H800, and A800 sold. GeForce weakness won't be in focus and crypto mining died when Ethereum switched away from PoW. So calls it is. I?셝 just like to point out that the cost of an A100 chip has changed from $10,000 in February to $40,000 now. Holy shit I ain?셳 selling shit.

2023-08-18,"AMD fix high idle power PLEASE A single 1440p monitor should not be eating 105 watts max of power. Just having it plugged in with the monitor off doesn't even decrease idle power. Model is Asus VG32AQL1A 32"". No I'm not overcloking it, I even tried downclocking to 120hz/60hz, no change. Also I should mention I'm running it on a 7900 XTX. Latest driver. EDIT: I appreciate the help but I've already tried these things a million times: -Enable freesync -Disabling freesync -Enabling VRR -Lowering power limit -Lowering voltage -Use different monitor (other high refresh rate monitors like LG work perfectly fine on it) -Using different cables -DDU reinstalling drivers -Updating chipset -Lowering refreshrate -updating to 23.8.1 None of the above have worked. EDIT #2: So I updated adrenaline to 23.8.1 which just came out today, still at 100 watts idle. Still not fixed. You only have one monitor? I thought it only happened to people with two. I use two monitors and never had this issue since I bought it 2 months ago. Mine is 10-20w, I hope it gets fixed soon for everyone. I have a Powercolor Hellhound 7900XTX paired with a Samsung Odyssey G5 (34"" UWQHD) with a 165hz refresh rate via DisplayPort and I'm idling right now at 6W-9W. However, if I plug up my 4K Samsung TV into the HDMI port as a second monitor, usage idles around 70-90W. Seems like it doesn't play well with your monitor for whatever reason. Probably won't make a difference, but are you using HDMI or DisplayPort? AMD really needs to fix this crap. I just looked at my 7800X 3D/RTX 4090 PC. Its pulling exactly 94 watts with two monitors while watching a YT video and rendering a video in premiere. I did recently grab an XTX too though and never really looked at it, its in my living room hooked up to a 120hz oled TV and just checked it out because of this post and mine pulls around 17 watts on idle with some jumps to 32. If I play a YT video it goes between 47 and 69 (gigity) Not sure what's happening with you but sounds like something may be utilizing it perhaps. I'm running on driver 23.10.23.03 and have the card manually overclocked +15% power limit 1070mv undervolt 3ghz max. It's a Sapphire Nitro+. 7800X 3D/RTX 4090 PC. Its pulling exactly 94 watts with two monitors I have a 7950X3D with a 4090 (undervolted) and I am pulling ~200 Watts even with my monitor (38"" Alienware ultrawide) turned off and nothing but chrome open. Are you measuring at the wall or software? Because software is usually wrong and shows low for me as well. He already said it???fine with 2 other monitors. Looks like a monitor compatibility issue. Op should be updating the original post. Why are there so many people in this thread trying to dismiss this as a non-issue or somehow specific to OP? This is a known issue. It has been mentioned in driver release notes. The most recent driver noted that progress was made on solving the issue, but not that it was solved. There are many 7900xtx users, including myself, still with ~100w idle power usage awaiting a fix. You can also include 7900XT users as well, x2 (from my end) that have this exact issue. This is the reason why I don't know if I can bring myself to buy the 7900xt. This is such a stupid issue and they haven't fixed it after 8 months.  AMD can't find out how to fix this, while these cards have been released like eight months ago, it's just a shame . The VRAM boosting in idle for no reason is the reason for this . Probably because it???such an inconsistent issue lol hi, seems to be a monitor specific issue... no surprise considering asus displays... got currently 3 displays hooked up and sitting at about 55watts draw atm, but i've also video and content running constantly... Have you tried CVT Reduced Blanking in the display options? Holyshit, every comment here is like ""have you tried unplugging and plugging your PC?"" As if this is not a very well known issue. Any corporation should be lucky to have such dedicated fans, why'd they ever need to fix a driver bug like this when everyone acts like a social media soldier for them. Even the top comment is indirectly suggesting that this is a normal issue that happens to RTX40 series when the RTX40 series is known for sipping power on idle and light and being very efficient. Weird responses to a well known issue all around. I would return that card. High idle power draw with just a single monitor is really odd, plus you lowered the refresh rate and had no change. I've gone through 2 of them already and they had the same issue My RX 6700 is always on 25W at idle. my 6700xt idles at 5w Also 100w on idle here, dual monitor setup.
The workaround is no option as it changes the image quality.

2023-08-21,"$NVDA Bear Guys tomorrow ?맶 ?얞artGuy69420 said that the AI-bubble will pop and Nvidia is just a scam??thats why i bet the house?エ If that is tomorrows NVDA chart, she will love the surprise... Get on the train to 700 lads Bubbles bursting soon baby! Nvidia's current price action is based on the regarded belief that it holds (and will hold for an extended period of time) some kind of monopoly in AI (which they don't). This shows how regarded the market is. By that, I predict Nvidia to go up tomorrow, just based on the level of regardedness I've seen until now. I'm opening puts after IV falls If they don't have a hardware monopoly, then who are the other players? I'm talking about other players that aren't a COUNTRY MILE behind them?  Analyst estimates for next quarter is $12.5b..its almost as if they want nvidia to rip higher after earnings?    evenue estimates would be around atleast $15b for the next quarter but nope? Puts on $NVDA Premiums like a meme stock. Bodes poorly. I'm selling juicy covered calls but starting to be sad that my shares may get called away.. Price basis 180 though so whatever Nvidia is expensively valued but tricky to bet against.  Nvidia is cashing in now by selling the chips that all these AI start ups will need to build their copycat products . The mania on the software side will sustain demand for these chips and NVIDIA is more than happy to dispense them . Im not touching it though. Yea this is the only reason I?셫 not jumping in with puts. Is NVDA overvalued? Absolutely. Is the AI hype fake? Absolutely. But even though the California gold rush was fake, there was still a fortune to be made by selling shovels. Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment Would you capture it or just let it slip? This is the play we have been waiting for, PUTS I believe I saw someone went in on puts last week  The more puts you guys buy, the more the big guys are going to squeeze the living shit out of you . fundamentals and technical analysis doesn't mean anything .

So I can confidently skip this generation of GPUs entirely and just stick with my XFX 6800 XT Speedster Merc 319 for another couple of years. Hell, it even has more CU's and Stream Processors.

Rasterization performance will be similar between the two cards. Though I imagine the the 7800 XT will pull ahead in ray tracing. Biggest wild card is if cache makes much of a difference as the 7800 XT only has 64mb vs the 128mb in the 6800 XT. RX 6800 XT has 72 CUs, not 70. You missed a key feature: Infinity Cache. The 6800XT has 128mb while the 7800XT has 64mb. AMD claims there???nothing stopping Starfield from adding Nvidia DLSS There is only one way to corroborate this claim. Adding DLSS 3.5 in Starfield. :) is so supportive of games adding other upscalers, then please tell me the following: Why are AMD sponsored games still mostly lacking other upscalers. DLSS and XeSS?Why is AMD still not pa there's no RT in Starfield so there's no point for 3.5 but DLSS would be nice. It's also TheVerge.. They waited months with no comments to say this now a week before launch.. Back tracking much? I don't know if I trust the AMD guy who hasn't paid his $10 bet from 3 years ago. In all seriousness, they can say whatever they want but at the end of the day, proof is in the pudding and even Hardware Unboxed has covered the story here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8Lcjq2Zc_s If AMD is so supportive of games adding other upscalers, then please tell me the following: Why are AMD sponsored games still mostly lacking other upscalers. DLSS and XeSS? Why is AMD still not part of open source Streamline SDK?  AMD mandating FSR for games sponsored by Nvidia or Intel . Why isn't it go the other way around when the games were sponsored by Intel or Nvidia? AMD should add FSR into the open source Streamline SDK . At the end of the day, Frank ""never paid $10"" Azor can say anything he wants and AMD may well claim they are not blocking DLSS/XeSS directly but they can still make it difficult thus indirectly blocking said access. I think either it's an outright false statement, or AMD is suggesting that there are no hard barriers/contracts outright forbidding competing upscalers... but there are enough ""incentives"" that drive this phenomenon. Or they are backtracking on what were hard requirements for exclusivity, and making it sound like there never was one.  Bethesda could put out a day-1 patch that includes DLSS support . Probably won't happen, though . If we do, we're going to see support via Nvidia driver update first . Could be weeks/months if at all . I smell BS. I'm guessing they saw the amount of crap they were getting for blocking DLSS a few weeks back and are trying to backtrack. Hopefully this does mean we might get DLSS at some point for Starfield at least. I suspect it's more in the lines of that they were trying to add FSR 3 until the last moment, but couldn't make it work properly on the Starfield engine. Now that they can't use it as an advertisement for FSR 3, they don't mind to get some positive PR and allow DLSS. Especially if the game will be too CPU bottlenecked and require Frame Generation type tech. Which is, I presume, why their previous responses were ""no comment"" and they had nothing to say until months after the drama broke... because that makes sense. Nothing takes the weight off your partners like simply refusing to answer a question for months whilst you formulate the best way to not answer said question. But is Starfield contractually AMD-exclusive? Perhaps just temporarily exclusive? Azor isn???going to say. Which leads into the above as the crux of the issue which they still haven't provided an answer for. It doesn't matter if they ""always say yes"" when developers ask to do DLSS if that entails rewriting the contract terms and adjusting compensation accordingly. This is just a fancy and carefully worded way of saying they may or may not pay for exclusivity but their sponsorships aren't contingent on it. Which we already knew since Sony appear to have made a point of doing this for their AMD sponsored titles. Great, looking forward to AMD joining Nvidia Streamline posthaste! We'll know soon enough. Either the game ships with DLSS or AMD is full of shit. Spoiler: it's the latter because they could have just said it launches with DLSS and shut up everyone otherwise. Acting like it's Bethesda's choice whether or not they'll implement DLSS when they held them hostage just long enough so they can no longer feasibly launch with it, and then pretend that didn't happen. Pathetic behavior. And why wouldn't Bethesda want DLSS in Starfield, when every single game of theirs since 2019, Redfall, HiFi Rush, Ghost Wire Tokyo, Deathloop, Doom Eternal, Wolfenstein: Youngblood ALL support DLSS? Edit: btw their old game Elder Scrolls Online also supports DLSS and it's the first to support DLAA. As usual, the graph. None of those were actually developed by Bestheda themselves, they were only the publishers for those titles under Bestheda Softworks. good add dlss then Words mean nothing when ""actions""/patterns contradict them That???a fat load of shit. Other AMD sponsored games still don???use other upscalers. I???hope im wrong. Doubt. Frame generation with FSR's shitty motion handling is going to look so funny Will make a nice FPS uplift in static screenshots for their marketing slides while anything in motion remains a smeary ghosted mess First Look at AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 Also note the new Native Mode for FSR. A lot of people (or rather: a very vocal group of people here on r/AMD) wanted this as AMD's alternative to DLAA. This is honestly the best bit. FSR2 at native is a great way to tackle aliasing I can't believe they didn't post a short video clip. How can you talk about frame generation and give us stills? They have live demo running at Gamescom and Digital Foundry has checked that. Digital Foundry hands-on impressions are here, answering some of the questions I've seen elsewhere in the comments https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-amd-reveals-long-awaited-fsr-3-tech-and-frame-gen-for-every-dx11dx12-game Not hands-on, they specifically specify they could not interact with the setup Nice, thanks. Looking more promising than I was expecting The things that I took from this and the gamescomm stream in my own words. Frame generation latency is only as good as the FPS BEFORE ADDING THE FRAMES. So if you was running 60FPS before enabling it and its running 120FPS, the latency will feel like 60 FPS. You can fake frames but you cant fake latency. They are giving these features out for everyone to use regardless of hardware but do reserve a few features for AMD users only like ANTILAG+ and the feature to add FG to any direct X game on the driver level in upcoming drivers. FSR Native AA mode can no be used to replace AA methods in games and we will prob see DEVS who are integrating FSR anyways start using this as their main AA methods. Game developers cant use FSR FG as a crutch if they cant hit at least 60FPS with it turned off. This will pose issues for the Xbox series S moving forward. You can fake frames but you cant fake latency. You've obviously never heard of negative latency. Just a quick thing I caught and I thought was funny. AMD: We only recommend frame generation when you achieve atleast 60 FPS without it!! AMD on its next graph: Look how frame gen boost this game from sub 50 to nearly 80 FPS!! :D Edit: grammar The idea is interesting but we basically know nothing related to FSR 3: - can you only enable AFMF without enabling FSR 2? - how is the image quality when FSR 3.0 is enabled? - how much does FSR 3 increase latency? Btw looks promising but the games supported are meh. why forspoken and immortals of aveum? it would have been much better if they implemented FSR 3 in RE4 remake,star wars jedi survivor and starfield which are all AMD sponsored titles. The last part is bit concerning as they have shown no latency numbers. Antilag+ is also for rdna3 only. The old antilag if you are on rdna2 which has been shown to reduce latency only a tiny bit There's an FSR Native mode that can be used with or without Frame Gen. So, FSR TAA at native resolution, which finally allows us to replace Vaseline smear TAA in games, with or without Frame Gen. So, I'm fine with that. ??칊tive AA??stands for Native Anti-Aliasing and is a new quality mode being introduced in AMD FSR 3. Unlike the other modes, it lets you use AMD FSR 3 without applying any upscaling but still applies the high-quality anti-aliasing and sharpening of FSR for improved image quality over native resolution. Why forspoken and aveum ? Well these games are so poorly optimised you can't have decent frame rate without such upscaling algorithms. I think it's because of how Nvidia advertised dlss in the first place, like it was a feature to have better graphics, with lower cost. No upscaling algo beats native resolution rendering lol at showing static game screenshots for frame generation. anti lag + only 7000 series and above makes me sad It is flabbergasting that Starfield does not support FSR 3.0, but the tech looks promising none the less. Hopefully it will find its way into Witcher 3 Enhanced Edition :) I want FSR3 in any CPU limited game that drops way below 100 fps Let the nagging begin Gotta love it wee went from ??뾥y isn???there any news??to ??짻R 3 is gonna suck??really quick.",2

Lets get up and down for a reason Shell en ASML aandelen Zal ik de strategie ?쁖WCE and Chill??hanteren? Of is het ook verstandig om wat aandelen te kopen zoals Shell en ASML? De vraag achter de vraag is. Met welke reden of op basis van welke strategie zou je die willen kopen? Of is dit fomo?

Lees boeken erover zoals ?쁀andelen selecteren als een pro??of ?쁡e kaviaar formule??of ?쁧e leeftijd als goudmijn?? Heb je geen zin om hier aan te beginnen zoals menig ander. Koop dan een indexfonds als VWCE en doe niets anders. Aandelen selecteren is echt lastig. Je verslaat niet zomaar een indexfonds door lukraak wat te kopen Mijn advies is om naar de toekomst te kijken. Ooit zag ik steeds meer mensen met witte oortjes rondlopen. Toen was beleggen in Apple niet eenvoudig en heb ik die boot gemist. Een paar jaar geleden zag ik dat er steeds meer elektrische auto?셲 kwamen en heb aandelen van n bekend merk gekocht. Ik zie dat alleen nog maar verder toenemen. Dus die aandelen houd ik nog wel even. Verwacht je dat olie een groeimarkt is/wordt? Verwacht je dat chips steeds belangrijker worden? Naast je eigen verwachting is de verwachting van de markt ook belangrijk. Als de markt namelijk exact hetzelfde verwacht, is dit al in de koers verwerkt en zal het aandeel de bestaande verwachtingen zelfs moeten overtreffen. VWCE has 60% north american exposure. Shell is British, ASML Dutch If you want to decrease your USA exposure ( diversifiction ), you can definetly buy these stocks. However, do some research on these stocks, don?셳 just buy them for the sake of diversification Vwce and chill Zelfs als het een goed idee was om dergelijke aandelen te kopen, dan heeft het meer zin om een indexfonds te nemen dat in hun sectoren of achterliggende economie챘n (zeg Europe) investeert.

2023-09-01,"Is this all due to a 5 million difference in consensus Then its on sale now Starfield NVIDIA vs. AMD Performance It???a Bethesda game, poor performance is a feature. The universal disparity between average FPS and 1% lows across every GPU they tested definitely seems to indicate a problem with the engine that can hopefully be patched Absolutely sad how bad games run today. There seems to genuinely be zero optimization and these lazy devs expect people to just toss on upscaling like DLSS or FSR and get frames that way. Really hope this improves going forward or it???not gonna matter how much you spend on a GPU.  I can't help but feel like this is a dark day for pc gaming . You spend over $1000 just for a video card, not even talking about the rest of the rig, and you can't run this game at high, not ultra, high, at 4k 60fps . It doesn't even have half the eye-candy it still kinda makes you look over at the rig next to you and go WTF? Hit the nail on the head for me, I am actually worried my 3070 was a bad choice but, I was lucky to even have been able to get anything during the whole craziness that was going on at the time. I don???want to already feel like I have to think about upgrading when I figured it would hold up well for 1080p gaming for a good chunk of years. I still hope that???true. it's literally day 1  Why must it be unreasonable for us consumers to expect a product to work when it's released? If you bought a car and it didn't have half the features it should, you'd probably demand a refund . But massive studios? Let's not make excuses for them. They've had the time to make it right, they could have taken more The current xx60ti card can just about manage 60 fps at 1080p high without upscale(!)...absolutely disgusting performance. Welp guess my GTX 1080 is too old now lol there is literally nothing exciting, innovative, or 'next gen' about ANY technical aspect of this game, and yet it runs like dogshit. what a joke. there is literally nothing exciting, innovative, or 'next gen' about ANY aspect of this game The price tag surely feels next gen though This one isnt even doing HBM Why on earth Hbm cant sell it to China And the economy of scale is worse than that of Samsung Hynix I thought it would naturally fall behind in the competition and lose its stock price but why is it going up The performance is not good either [News] Goldman Sachs: TSMC to Win Big with Intel?셲 Increased Outsourcing Goldman Sachs??analysis reveals that the total addressable market of Intel?셲 outsourcing orders for 2024 and 2025 is set at $18.6 billion and $19.4 billion, respectively. Something is still very wrong over there at Intel and apparently not even Pat fix it. Pattex fixes everything And pat just pumped it up yesterday claiming how well things were going! I'll bet that Ericsson made a pre-payment because pat ""incentivized"" the deal to the point where it was a no brainer. Pat is betting that if one customer commits, others will follow... But others will wonder why Intel is ordering more from competitor instead. I wonder if they do this on purpose to squeeze TSMCs capacities further, preventing especially AMD from getting further capacities. Maybe its a mixture of both things, no confidence in its own process plus tighting caps.  Intel and its ex- and now current leadership would be it. Intel is trying to undermine others. I really don't think they have other real strategies or they wouldn't have brought the daemon back to make up phony schedules . It reminds me of when I would play DOOM II in the labs at school and someone would get the rocket launcher. My first reaction was to go grab all the rockets. Except it was a game; not the reputation of 100 thousand workers. And I didn't cover my tracks with lies. Maybe when AMD was tiny and INTC had massive free cash flow, one could easily picture this conspiracy theory. They can't afford to buy wafers now that they don't intend to sell for profit. In these lean times, I think it's more that Intel is forced to go with the most cost-effective option rather than the highest performing or most strategic option. If they had capacity and a cost advantage with internal wafers, I think they would have to use it rather than slashing employee benefits and shutting down business units. Yeah. That means they have to pay huge premium for 3nm and subsequent low margin. Additionally, other designers now have a doubt on the quality and yield of intel wafers, since they are funding their competitor. Pretty crazy move by Intel. They made the contracts years ago and TSMC can plan their capacity. Now Intel delaydd a lot of orders at tsmc so there is extra supply. If its a devious plan it did not work Imagine if intel new processor on tsmc nodes are totally trash... Check the source.

But China's aim is to decouple from the West in thinking, which is much more serious than economic and trade decoupling - and the US is helping China to achieve that.

I've heard that gaia is laquer based, but I'm not sure if I'm actually able to use this kind of Laquer thinner or any of these alternatives? Only the lacquer thinner, and seeing as that?셲 store bought lacquer, it?셲 very ?쐆ot?? You?셪l run into issues with drying too fast and possible crazing of paint or primer layers underneath unless you do very light coats. A better choice would be a hobby lacquer thinner like Gaia?셲 own, or Mr. Color Leveling Thinner (the best). Those Vallejo and Tamiya thinners you?셱e showing are water acrylic and alcohol acrylic based - they?셪l most likely react badly with your Gaia paint. So theoretically, I would be able to do fine if I apply the gaia over a primer but in super light coats at a time and let it dry fully in between coats? If this is all you can get at the moment then use the Lacquer Thinner. In the future just get yourself a bottle of Mr Leveling Thinner. It's all I use. I buy it in bulk Would the lacquer thinner mess the application up on a gunpla piece like they Say? How would u suggest avoiding any issues if I Do use it Hey Mr Rex! If I may ask... Is tamiyas x-20a thinner also a laquer? Does work with paints such as Mr Hobby? Or are tamiya and Mr. Hobby paints both alcohol based? Maybe one day try kleen strip +retarder... There's only so many chemicals in the world right? Maybe you make next best thing? As others have said, the Klean Strip will work, but it?셲 a fast and pretty harsh thinner. Mixed with Gaiai, it will tend to create a matte finish. It may also react with some plastics adversely, particularly if sprayed heavily. It will clean the Gaia right up, though, when you?셱e done. Gaia plus a bunch of MLT is some of the best spraying, smoothest paint you?셪l find. Makes a nice ?쐁andy??shell. I wouldn?셳. Use the branded thinner for each paint. Dear AMD Card User, (and some Nvidia users too) _____________________________________________________________________ If you can't see the sun ingame, here's a fix: Thank you for @Other_Ad_5313 for finding this out. Navigate to your game folder under Steam\steamapps\common\Starfield. Here you will find your graphics presets, labeled low.ini , medium.ini, high.ini and ultra.ini. Add the following line to EVERY of you graphics inis: [ViewDistance]fFardistance=100000000 This way my game now correctly renders the sun and all it's effects. ! At this point in time, i don't know if this has any impact on performance or why it has to be this exact high number of draw disance ! ORIGINAL POST: i hate to break it to you, since you probably haven't noticed yet. But it is necessary for the problem to finally get attention: If you travel to for example the dayside of a moon without atmosphere, you will probably just see this whereas you SHOULD see this This also goes for planets with atmosphere. You will just be seeing this Your game does NOT render the sun. There will be light and shadow effects, but you're out of luck to ever see the sun, no matter the planet or moon with/without atmosphere. This is likely to be a problem with ALL (Edit: most) newer AMD 6000 and 7000 Series cards. Unfortunately there's yet to be alot of traction around this problem, probably because no one is really noticing. If you have one of those newer cards, please share you experiences. NOTICE: Picture 1 and 2 are screenshots Discord-User @Phesent posted to the Bethesda bug-page. I deleted my game, since i don't want to play until this gets resolved. ______________________________ EDIT 11/09: Thanks guys for making so much noise around this issue. Some major PC-Gaming outlets have already published articles about this problem. Some more conclusions as we get more data from other users: On some 6 and 7 Series AMD cards, it works just fine Few Nvidia Cards also have this issue (can't change the title of my post unfortunately) Xbox seems not affected Still, this seems to be a widespread problem. Let's hope the media attention gets Bethesda or AMD respectively to finally get a hotfix out for this and all the other issues existing in Starfield. EDIT 14/09: According to a news article by PCGamer.com, AMD is aware of this issue, but doesnt have ""a timeline for fixing"" it yet. Newest Starfield Hotfix 1.7.29 didnt adress the issue unfortunately. People, please upvote this post, so that Bethesda can see it and hopefully deliver a fix in the near future... It sucks that so many didn't even notice this, it's a total immersion-killer for me and for many others. Still insane to me how no one seems to give a fuck ? It doesn't affect you so you just ""meh"" at it ? Cmon talk about it people ! Is this for real? Is Bethesda???entire testing department all using Nvidia cards??? The performance of nVidia GPUs in this game is just trash. Probably Bethesda's fault. Oh shit this happened to me yesterday on a planet. I saw light coming on the surface and embraced for the beautiful sunrise but couldn???see the sun. Was confused as hell, I???using rx6600. Does this happen on Xbox (since they are using somewhat modified RDNA2) ? If not I probably switch to my Series X until it???fixed for PC. Noticed this day one of early access. It has been driving me crazy. Not to say I'm happy others have to suffer too, but at least I'm not alone. Everyone, please make sure to submit a report to Bethesda and AMD if you have the time. you can report it here to amd https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/amdbrt the more people the better WTF. just add [ViewDistance] fFarDistance=100000000 in the Medium.ini or Low.ini or High.ini or Ultra.ini It works on my computer So much for being an AMD sponsored game... As ignored as this problem seems to be, this won't even be fixed in the next patch (whenever bethesda decides to deliver) It finally got attention: https://wccftech.com/starfield-is-seemingly-missing-entire-stars-when-running-on-amd-radeon-gpus/?fbclid=IwAR091-_j0idE2q5DGqrgtr_QrKwdnKdcqW8nlimh7_QjS7EpYHJEAxIBRME I mean??I???on Xbox and I don???think I??턤 ever noticed the sun.. I???assuming it???there but I wouldn???had known if it wasn???lol We need more attention! Please up-vote if you see this post! At least you guys are getting decent frames Same Bug Nvidia 980gtx in know its below min specs. but except the missing sun game runs great... no mods ini tweaks etc. clean gamepass premium version. Edit: Seems a weird bug. Try alt-tab during the game and the sun appears back for a sek. i'm also pretty sure theres a ini tweak to solve the problem as a workaround. im just too lazy to look after all graphic and/or sky/cellestial related. maybe someone has the mood to dive into the problem. Here are Lists with all the ini settings https://stepmodifications.org/forum/topic/19019-starfield-default-values-for-all-known-valid-ini-settings/ Same for me on 7900 XTX. Any fix yet? What the actual fuck, I did think it was odd that I could never see the star in the sky lol, nothing new, new games are unfinished messes regardless of graphics cards you use, nobody seem to remember cyberpunk :P wait a month and then hopefully it gets fixed by Bethesda and have a 20% performance boost Joe Biden is a good president. I didn't vote for the guy in 2020, I was a bit more apolitical at the time, didnt vote in that election. And maybe I feel the way I feel because I went into his presidency with low expectations But dammit if I haven't been surprised on more than one occasion. First, I want to dispell some common misconceptions and adress some of the most common criticisms. Gas Prices: Many on the right claim Biden has cut US Oil production; this couldn't be farther from the truth. US oil production is higher now than any year in the last decade except 2019. 2020, Trumps last year in office, there was the biggest cut to oil production in US History. We are on track to pass 2019 levels.  Inflation is something we, and multiple countries around the world, knew we would be dealing with since Summer 2020 . Between the biggest cut in oil production in US history and nearly 15% Unemployment, manufacturing globally haulted, not just the US, but multiple other countries knew the hardships we would face after we normalized, before Biden ever became president 3. Afghanistan Withdrawl: We knew we would be fully withdrawling from Afghanstan 11 months before Biden even took office. Trump made a peace deal with the taliban that did not involve the Afghan government agreeing for the US to full withdrawl Afghanistan. Biden decided to follow through. Leaving was long overdue. He even extended the withdrawl date by 3 months. We didn't just randomly out the blue leave. Everyone knew this was happening. Now let's move on. Legislative Achievments Two note worthy pieces of Legislation President Biden signed into law are the Infrastracture Bill and the CHIPS Act. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684 This is the most signicant investment in our nations infrastructure in decades. Some of things in this bill include Delivering clean water to more American families by eliminating the nation?셲 lead service lines.  Getting more Americans access to reliable high-speed internet. Repairing and rebuilding our roads and bridges Improving transportation options for millions of Americans and reducing greenhouse emissions through the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Upgrading our nation?셲 airports and ports to strengthen our supply chains. Making the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak.  Building a national network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers.  Delivering the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells.  CHIPS and Science Act https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346 The CHIPS and Science Act provides funds to support the domestic production of semiconductors and authorizes various programs and activities of the federal science agencies. It will Bolster U.S. leadership in semiconductors.  And some may say ""anyone could of done this"" then why didn't the former president? When Republicans last had full government control the most significant legislation they passed was a 2Trillion dollar Tax Cut that cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.  I've been surprised at Bidens ability to not only be Bipartisan and give Republicans the opportunity to work together, but he knows when to put his foot down . I've also been pleasantly surprised at his willingness to call out traitorous MAGA Republicans . His handling of Ukraine has been recognized globally as superb. He called out Russians invasion plan in advance to the disbelief of many, including myself. Is he everything I want in a President? No. And in 2028, we can get someone younger. The incumbent advantage is strong and not worth throwing away. Biden is also probably one of if not the most experienced politician Alive on the planet. Decades in the US Senate, 8 years as VP, relationships with many dems and Republicans, familiarity with our allies. His age is really his biggest issue, but even with his age as a hindrance he has still managed to be an effective leader. He isn't perfect, he's probably corrupt, and he's a liar like a lot of politicians. I want my student loan forgiven. Just as Mr Biden has promised. Tick Tock Still seems unfair you took out money. Why can?셳 I get my loans forgiven just because I didn?셳 get loans for school. ?쁻 He is a PHENOMENAL president if one's goal was, ""Anyone but Trump"". That's about it... Trump wasn?셳 even bad. How do you do, fellow kids? Great points. Biden being a good President is not so unpopular. The cult members are just loud. There is another viewpoint to every point you just made. And then when it comes to Russia, the argument is based off of the fact that there is conflict with them in the first place. That being said, there are points on here that could be arguably avoided rather than considering the reaction and achievement. Edit: the last point you made is not really a great thing. You would have to acknowledge all of his political history that is not truly great at all. Most people forgot about his infamously botched presidential run where he plagiarized his entire speech and his connections with former KKK members who he referred to as his mentor...  Biden was a KKK member for a couple years in his 20s . He then went on to be a US Senator from WV for 51 years . Biden had been a Senator for over 12 years when Biden first became a part of our government . I think in that instance it's safe to say him, and the many people who spoke in favor of this man at his passing are referring to the man they knew, not the one he was prior. I'm also not saying Biden is perfect, dudes a corrupt liar like a lot of politicians Lol sees a post about Biden being a bad president and goes to fish for karma on the other end of the argument. At least you acknowledge it?셲 an unpopular opinion I think you're confusing Biden with Mitch",0

The idea is to use  I believe this happens because my onboard ethernet NIC is in the same IOMMU group as the wifi card (group 7) I tried using ""pci_acs_override"", it activates (I have in the log Warning: PCIe ACS overrides enabled; This may allow non -IOMMU protected peer-to-peer D GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet intel_iommu=on iommu=pt pcie_acs_override=downstream"" GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""quiet intel_iommu=on iommu=pt pcie_acs_override=downstream,multifunction"" update grub and reboot. The result is the same, is there something I'm doing wrong? My setup:Dell Optiplex 3080I5-10400tpve-manager/8.0.4(running kernel: 6.2.16-12-pve) My output of for d in /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/*/devices/*; do n=${d#*/iommu_groups/*}; n=${n%%/*}; printf 'IOMMU group %s ' ""$n""; lspci -nns ""${d##*/}""; done: A screenshot for a better view: IOMMU Groups I saw something about recompiling the kernel, if I'm not mistaken, making some changes such as removing the pci_find_ext_capability(dev, PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_ACS)) line, would this be the way to go?Thanks. Did you enable iommu on your Bios? Some machines have like 3 iommu options to enable for that to work properly. In my BIOS I have only Intel Virtualization Technology and VT for Direct I/O, both enabled, nothing related to IOMMU. This is the part where you say ""my hardware just doesn't support that"" and either get hardware that does, or find another solution, the ACS patch allows users to do unsafe things on the off-chance that it works, this crashed your computer, it's not safe to use on that hardware TSMC: Shortage of Nvidia's AI GPUs to Persist for 1.5 Years They're not having issues keeping up with demand of making regular 4nn wafers, such as the H100 core, and AD102/103/104/ect...  TSMC doesn't have enough capacity for CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate) capacity . The problem only affects AI/datacenter gpus that use HBM and/or MCM . The H100, A100, MI200, MI300, and TPUv3 are the cards affected by this shortage . Consumer cards aren't affected by this at all since even AMD's RX-7000 gpus that use MCM don't use any of the CoWoS that TSMC is struggling with, and RTX 4000 cards are completely monolithic.  Nvidia has no problem with not being able to get enough 4nm dies from TSMC for any of their GPUs . Making more H100 dies is useless since they can't be used until there's avaliable space for CoWoS step . Sitting on a warehouse of complete and unusable H100s is pointless and can hurt them when they Good points! This is also one of the primary reasons Navi41 was cancelled. This is why I guessed that Nvidia is the ""large customer"" that prepaid for 18A capacity from Intel. They probably could handle at least some of the capacity that Nvidia needs. I wonder if they use the same machines.  I wonder if it would be worth it for them to build/design an AI/HPC focused GPU with a wide GDDR memory controller again . Sure, it's very likely not as efficient or cost effective, but does that matter when you have people buying your stuff for tens of thousands a pop and you can't keep up with demand? Imagine selling cards at $40K each and you are sold out for the next 2 years. NVIDIA is printing money. It's always been a packaging capacity problem not litho and it seems packaging will keep getting more complex Good chance the bubble will crash before then. Is it misleading though? It says AI GPU's in the title, when I read that I immediately assumed it was the AI cards and nothing to do with their gaming stuff otherwise I think they would have just put GPU's Misleading title, this is not about Graphic chips, but only about H100 AI chips. the title says ""AI GPUs""",-4
2023-09-08," ASML CEO Peter Wennink said isolating China completely will be ?쐆opeless??and ? NK, Iran and Cuba are the innovation powerhouses of the world. lol Of course he would say that. ?쏧 truly just want to make a few more bucks??$ASML and I wish I wasn't being forced by the US government to not do what I want  The ASML EUV machine comprises over 400,000 parts, sourced from multiple countries, not just one . At least now, they won't have access to certain high-end technology that could potentially be reverse-engineered . in the same way that you should never get political opinions from entertainers or comedians, you should never get them from CEOs. Simply too many conflicts of interest. Even if you were a theoretically non greedy CEO, if you have dealings with China, a backlash could cost you the fortunes of your company and thus employees. You're held hostage by your business interests. And just assume that the rest saying ""After EUV we are good"" and sitting around and did nothing. Many of those countries (Netherlands, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, USA) are still spending huge amount in R&D every year. Capex and R&D is still far ahead of Chinese semiconductor industry. https://www.eetasia.com/u-s-chip-suppliers-continue-to-dominate-rd-spending/ Lemme fix that for you. It will just cause China to ramp up trade espionage and IP theft. No way China is going to be honest about its development. And actually do research when it?셲 easier for them to steal trade secrets. China's technological progress is overrated and underrated at the same time. Example: the Kirin 9000s is made in China by SMIC using Chinese bought it equipment. It's basically a 7nm chip and has 5G capabilities. People are making excuses saying it was from 2020 but sources from China and the west have debunked that. On the other hand, you see so many people shitting themselves with excitement (r/sino) about this new chipset. Yes, it's the best breakthrough China has had in a while, but no, the US hasn't been defeated""."" China won't become the technological powerhouse, displacing the US and Taiwan, but it's likely they will continue making steady progress with the odd breakthrough causing panic in the west. I heard the same when MS barred the use of illegal win in China lol Yes. China is so innovative so they spend ungodly amount of human resources and money to catching up with things like EUV, an R&D program by US Department of Energy from the 1990s. A reminder that EUV was made possible because many countries and companies in Europe, Japan, US joined the effort. China under isolation will basically need to steal and play catch up all the time because Xinnie the Pooh wants juche"" for semiconductors and antagonize those countries with wolf warrior diplomacy."" https://www.euvlitho.com/Blogs/EUVL_%20Status%20and%20Challenges%20Ahead%20(2003%20Fabtech).pdf China did that to itself for hundreds of years. It didn?셳 work out well. This is a true corporation greed. Oh gosh CEO of the great ASML has given his words! Omg whatever shall we do! His words must be true! Dear lord we should listen and work with him I?셫 confuse??they make it sound like without sanctions, China aren?셳 trying to be self sufficient anyway. OK. So where is the big crime in that? Are they not allowed to become self sufficient in high tech? Since 2022 the Biden administration has also wanted to bring supply chains back to the US so the US could become self sufficient. Are you denouncing the US for wanting to be self sufficient too? Well, they?셝 have to start coming up with her own stuff someday. Being isolated, not being able to steal most of your technology and ideas from western countries, definitely would force requirement to start innovating. It's not just ASML. The CEOs of Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel recently all called for a pause in the trade sanctions against China. They all realize it's not working. It's leading to a lose-lose situation. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-21/chip-ceos-urge-us-to-study-impact-of-china-curbs-and-take-pause They all realize it's not working. They realize it will hurt their bottom line. China will chose domestic inferior products for national security reasons, see recent Iphone announcement. At a minimum locking them out of at least parts of the Chinese market. Never listen to companies when it comes to national security issues. Private profits from foreign markets and national security seldom align. GoogleAmazonAppleMetaMSTikTok face EU regulatory bombshell  Alphabet Google Amazon Apple Meta Microsoft MS and Chinas ByteDance TikTok have been targeted by the European Unions superstrong regulatory legislation to prevent monopolizing the big tech market
The European Commission has designated six large platform operators including Alphabet Google Amazon Apple Meta Microsoft MS and Chinas ByteDance TikTok which will be subject to special regulations under the Digital Market Act DMA which will take effect in March next year A total of 22 major services including social media platforms app stores and operating systems OS provided by them are subject to regulation The six companies targeted for regulation cannot avoid shrinking their businesses in the EU immediately This is because it is necessary to revise business practices so far and if you violate the law you will be fined up to 10 of your annual sales and up to 20 for repeated violations
Apple should allow rival smartphone users to download apps that could only be downloaded from the Apple Store after the law took effect and Google is prohibited from favoring its own search area such as shopping in general search results Amazon the worlds largest ecommerce company cannot prioritize its brand over other companies products when searching for products and Meta cannot combine user information between its social media such as Facebook and Instagram without the users permission
TikToks parent company China ByteDance also failed to escape the EUs regulatory bomb
The EUs decision is a strong special regulatory legislation that will no longer allow platform giants to monopolize the market designating users as gatekeepers who use their dominant position to tie them to their services like a cage Six companies designated gatekeepers will not be allowed to engage in business practices favorable to their services or exclusive business activities using data generated by their services in the EU from March next year forcing them to avoid falling sales due to business contraction Bloomberg News Agency",-2

I?셫 trying to average down but man it keeps free falling this is nuts. Intel (INTC) breaking out I've been keeping an eye on INTC recently. The chart indicates it's overbought with its RSI nearing 70. Yet, the stock remains stable. I'm uncertain about the cause of this rally. Interestingly, it's trading above its channel and, according to Webull's top-notch AI charting algorithm, the pattern suggests medium-term bullishness. I don't use Webull for trading, but I've heard their charting is top-tier. I stumbled upon this pattern accidentally while exploring a chart on their platform I'm putting my entire 401k in OTM puts expiring Friday. Why? This stock moves like 1% each month lol. Lucky I can only buy stupid mutual funds on my 401k A breakout would make perfect sense, since I sold off my $35 call four days ago. ah yes, Technical Astrology, the worst gambling instrument for Astrologers  Intel's 18A node shows a lot of promise to compete against TSMC's leading node throughout 2025 . Meteor Lake is also on track to release this year . This is a major shift finally proving that maybe Intel's new management isn't like Intel's old management, and they may actually make their ambitious plans happen.  Intel took an enormous beating in the recent years, and their situation was perceived as hopeless . They now started doing better than they have in nearly a decade, yet their stock price still hasn't recovered much from the very bottom .  AMD has a higher market cap with a fraction of Intel's business, and owning no manufacturing . While I like AMD, Intel's fab business alone has more earning potential, and they are also present in all the same markets that AMD is . that pentium power showing off I like intel long term but I don't think it's breaking out anytime soon  RSI isn't the only indicator that suggests INTC is overbought . MACD and stochastic oscillator are both signaling that the stock is due for a correction . I believe the rally still has some room to run as there's significant pent-up demand for tech stocks . TSMC https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-rumored-to-partner-with-nvidia-and-broadcom-on-silicon-photonics-tech This good news or bad ?ㅇ?띯셽截?$TSMC I'm not sure, butI don't think it will impact us either way. We manufacture our own chips for our hardware/systems. If TSMC was our contract manufacturing partner it might impact us, but they aren't. Maybe, it could bring down the cost of other systems and help accelerate adoption of various technologies(including ADAS/AD)? I saw a related X post with what appears to be a slide from Luminar?쫐as anyone seen this before? https://x.com/jshpigler/status/1701484871225327703?s=46&t=YkzldSvImcQcJSEyaD7j2Q Yeah he he finds some good stuff for sure, but yeah i didn't immediatly see the connection other than we are in the semiconductor business but I don't know. Screw it i'll ask him The luminar slide is from page 12 of the 2Q23 business update(it's on their website). The attached comment, on x, i have not seen before. There is still no association between the slide and the attached comment. There is no exlpanation of a link? Unless luminar is somehow joining the collaboration between TSMC and Nvidia, i don't see a link currently. Nobody has said that is happening. Do you think TSMC will see growth like NVDA What company do you think will see significant growth in tech following the AI rally I think that with the Japan plant recently finished the Arizona plant underway and increased demand for AI TSMC should see parallel growths to some AI manufacturers At least this is my wishful thinking But how many more years until we start seeing the gains of these new plants and increased production Wohoo TSMC is smashing It a bargain at 25 forward pe But wee all afraid of war So most of us won buy Time will tell Wee just at the beginning tho I holding long Currently 50 shares Maybe add some more if it keeps dipping i will be honest tsm wont grow even after earnings maybe it grows like 5 dollars I wonder how the stock will perform after today earthquake in Taiwan",4
2023-09-12,Biden is more deserving of a 2nd Term than Trump It is completely disingenuous to say his policies are a disaster they only just now are going to begin having an impact 20242026 is when we will truly be able to judge Bidens policies on the economy It is absolutely insane to expect the instant gratification you get online to play out in reality that isnt how the real world works We knew we would be dealing with high gas prices and hyper Inflation down the road since Summer 2020 The memo was screamed in our faces This was talked about a ton in multiple countries including the US  Unemployment peaked at nearly 15 global supply chains were crushed manufacturing worldwide haulted in a way never before seen in modern times The US had the biggest cut to Oil Production in history in 2020 Trumps last year in office When it comes to US Oil Production Currently we are producing more barrels of crude oil a day now than any year under Trump except 2019 and we are on track to pass that This is per the EIA httpswwweiagovdnavpethistLeafHandlerashxnPETsMCRFPUS2fM Furthermore compared to Trump Biden has absolutely been a Legislative Success Two note worthy pieces of Legislation President Biden signed into law are the Infrastracture Bill and the CHIPS Act Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act httpswwwcongressgovbill117thcongresshousebill3684 This is the most signicant investment in our nations infrastructure in decades Some of things in this bill include Delivering clean water to more American families by eliminating the nation lead service lines  Getting more Americans has access to reliable highspeed internet Repairing and rebuilding our roads and bridges Improving transportation options for millions of Americans and reducing greenhouse emissions through the largest investment in public transit in US history Upgrading our nation airports and ports to strengthen our supply chains Making the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak  Building a national network of electric vehicle EV chargers  Delivering the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites reclaiming abandoned mines and capping orphaned oil and gas wells  CHIPS and Science Act httpswwwcongressgovbill117thcongresshousebill4346 The CHIPS and Science  Act provides funds to support the domestic production of semiconductors and authorizes various programs and activities of the federal science agencies It will Bolster US leadership in semiconductors it will secure domestic supply create tens of thousands of goodpaying union construction jobs and thousands more highskilled manufacturing jobs and catalyze hundreds of billions more in private investment And recently its been discussed how funding from the Inflation Reduction Act is improving and modernizing the IRS The IRS said its going after 1600 millionaires who owe hundreds of millions in overdue taxes The agency said it will also be targeting 75 large business partnerships in the same situation The tax collection effort announced on Friday should start as soon as October Werfel said a massive hiring effort and AI research tools developed by IRS employees and contractors are playing a big role in identifying wealthy tax dodgers The agency is making an effort to showcase positive results from its burst of new funding under President Joe Bidens Democratic administration as Republicans in Congress look to claw back some of that money New tools are helping us see patterns and trends that we could not see before and as a result we have higher confidence on where to look and find where large partnerships are shielding income he said A team of academic economists and IRS researchers in 2021 found that the top 1 of US income earners fail to report more than 20 of their earnings to the IRS article continues The federal tax collector gained the enhanced ability to identify tax delinquents with resources provided by the Inflation Reduction Act which Biden signed into law in August of 2022 Comparitevely when Republicans last had full government control under Trump the most significant legislation they passed was a 2Trillion dollar Tax Cut that cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21  Infrastracture Week became a running gag Trump has already lost to Biden and has done way more to push voters away then gain them Trump himself literally costed Republicans statewide elections in 2022 in the same states Trump lost in 2020 that he would need to win in 2024 to secure the electoral college In the weeks leading up to Jan 6th Trump and his cohorts set up 84 fake electors across 7 states They then sent their fraudulent electors votes often without the Fake Electors knowledge to Congress to be used by certain elected officials and the Vice President or Grassley if Pence for some reason couldnt do it something grassley stated Jan 5th raising eyebrows of many to get the vote sent back to state legislators Trump himself preassured state legislators to overturn the election Most notably goergias SOS whom he told to find the exact number of votes he needed to just say theyve recalculated Telling him he knew what they did and if he didnt do something that would be criminal and bad for him and his lawyer He also made the most insane easily disprovable improbable claims that couldnt possibly be true as well as claims he had previously be told and explained were untrue This is all easily verifiable Audio recordings official documentation from Trumps own people and lawyers Testimony from republican officials He not long for this world And absolutely no one has faith in that potato Kamala What do the People of the United States deserve What they vote for Not Trump How much is the DNC paying you It like picking between being constipated or having diarrhea They both fucking suck Big surprise Pushing leftist propaganda on reddit Facts are leftist propaganda in your mind Reality is liberal according to this train of thought Biden is old and lagging mentally Sure if youre a war monger President Joe Biden recently appointed Victoria Nuland Dick Cheney point person on Iraq acting deputy secretary of state the department numbertwo official He named Eliot Abrams convicted perjurer and grim apologist for Central American torturers under Ronald Reagan to his Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy Bill Kristol perfervid lobbyist for the Iraq War cadged 2 million to pay for TV ads urging Republicans to stay the course in Ukraine War may or may not be the

POORER in 2022 per the Census Bureau Bidenomics woot woot httpshotaircomdavidstrom20230912censusbureaumedianincomeaftertaxesfell88in2022n577433 It is completely disingenuous to claim that is due to

believe he did that to me How much does the campaign pay you for this karma farming post I always find this funny because on the internet and somewhat in real life we see people simp over Trump but we never ask them if they are getting paid by the campaign Why do you think we have this hypocritical view No one eservesto be president This mentality is part of the reason we have to choose between a turd sandwich and a giant douche I agree Ill be voting for Cornell West because I live in arguably the bluest state in the country but if I were in a swing state I would probably vote Biden Easily the best president of the 21st century This sub has a lot of Biden Derangement Syndrome though so I expect to be downvoted for this That being said despite being the best of the century Biden is definitely too old He might be mentally fine now but where will he be in four years I dont understand why he wants a second term Stepping down after one term would look honorable especially after he got more stuff done in one term than Obama did in two I agree with much of what you wrote The one thing Joe has going for him is that he has proven he can beat Trump And another Trump term will set us back even further Jadi seller kok gini amat ya padahal cuma 1 pertanyaan lagi malah gak digubris cuma dibaca doang smh Kadang tergantung pertanyaannya juga sering loh calon customer nanya pertanyaan yang aneh2  ngelenceng dari produk Atau mungkin admin online shopnya bukan owner jadi kurang ngerti produk juga Tapi ya agreed selama pertanyaan masih seputar produk ya wajib dibalas Gw dulu jadi admin keitung 5 kali ada yang nanya 1 cm berapa mm ya min Beberapa waktu yang lalu gw nyari part kulkas ga ada yang persis no seri bagiannya cuma kata seller produk ini beda nomer tapi sama aja Ini 2 percakapan terakhir nya  Kalau pas dipasang ga sesuai bisa di balikin barangnya Baik kakTrimakasih atas kepercayaannya kepada kamiSemoga bermanfaat dan Sukses Selalu untuk Segalanya Amin yang panting bales  waktu itu pernah nanya lupa item apa min ini support x y z ga cari aja di YouTube banyak contohnya well goodbye it is then Kadang sellernya kurang pengetahuan teknis tentang barang yang dia jual Boro2 karyawan adminnya pemilik toko langsung aja belum tentu faham Gw honest aja ya mungkin sedikit honest dan frontal In my opinion and based on my experience jujur ya rata2 yg suka beginian cewek sih baik yg muda atau tua tapi gk semuanya yaaaaa kalau cowok mgkn yg tua2 aja yg judes kalau yg muda jarang gw ketemu judes kecuali preman awoakwok Customer service yg baik itu biasa cuman di bank doang sih di tempat lain apalagi tempat kalangan baw ahh sudahlah The thing is saya pribadi sebagai seller pasti menjawab pertanyaan buyer terlebih kadang saya juga kasih tahu procon dan tips barang yang saya jajakan Namun pas sekalinya saya menjadi konsumen dan pertanyaan saya cuma dijawab seadanya yaa agak gimana gitu Apalagi kalau tidak digubris ya pindah lapak lah saya walau harga beda tipis Jarangjarang sih bisa menemukan seller yang aktifnya sama kaya saya atau lebih baik dari saya sejauh yang saya alami Gw juga begini kalau masih ada pertanyaan tapi seller nya kelamaan atau jawab nggak jelas mending cari seller lain Nanti gimana kalau barang bermasalah respon nya juga nggak niat Intelektual orang berbeda Kebanyakan nanya padahal beli barang 20 ribu doang pake vocer pula Namanya resiko dagang online Masak cuma mau untungnya doang Seller yg bijak ga membeda2kan pembeli Mana tau seterusnya jadi langganan Rezeki bisa dateng dari jalan yang ga diduga2 Kdg gua ngerasa bersalah udh tanya panjang lebar trs ujung2nya mlh beli di toko lain  nanya doank beli kagak Sebagai orang uang sering belanja online dan jualan online kecilkecilan Terkadang bukan hanya kamu yang ditanya bisa aja buyer nanya 35 seller sekaligus dan duluduluan yang jawab atau layanan tetangga lebih baik dari layanan kamu Ini pun berasumsi harga barang sama Sebaga seller ukuran nano benerbener cuman jual barang bekas 12 item baru  bulan Gw gak masalah kalau pertanyaan calon pembeli itu banyak karena barang yang gw jual gw tau selukbeluknya Yang mengesalkan adalah kalau calon pembeli itu nanya halhal yang udah gw tuliskan dengan lengkap di deskripsi barang Kalau memang gw lupa nulis atau emang singkat karena batasan karakter yah sahsah aja Toh gw seneng aja ngejawabnya karena barang yang gw jual adalah barang yang gw sukai dan gw gak mau ngendep aja gak dipake akhirnya rusakjadi pemberat kertas aja di rumah Nego gak pakai otak karena gw jual barang bukan buat cari untung tapi biar barangnya gak ngendep aja gak dipake yah gw seringnya jual barang sedikit di bawah harga pasar untuk barang tersebut harga pasar bekasnya biar cepet kebeli toh hampir semuanya single item doang bukan yang berstokstok jadi ganggu harga pasar Kadang bisa sampai 1020 lebih murah dari harga terendah saat ini untuk barang dengan kondisi setara yah Tapi masih ada aja yang nawar bisa sampai 50 kurang dari harga tertera Kadang mau balas males sebenernya karena gak ngotak nawarnya Ngetik pake singkatan Bro buka tokopedia dari hape keyboard T9 kah ngtk cht hrs dsnkt2 bgn Sebagai pembeli olshop

2023-09-13,UserBenchmark purposefully filtering out GOOD AMD gpus I know we all know to avoid userbenchmark but what theyre doing now is extraordinarily scummy Ive been doing a series of testing the rx 7000 cards and found on userbenchmark for example the 7900 XTX they will NOT count your score if over 290 even if its 100 stable You will get a atypical extreme error meaning your gpu is too fast However this isnt the worst part but they will count really bad gpu scores that obviously point to a hardware issue Like what Not to mention if you were to overclock the crap out of a 4090 even if unstable on most games it would definitely not receive a atypical error Just look at the scores on the 4090 on userbenchshmuck That website is too far gone on the IntelNvidia fanboy scale you cant expect anything reasonable from them At this point AMD should probably just sue them for defamation and bankrupt them seeing as they seemingly exist for no reason other than to influence people against the purchase of AMD products Heck even Intel and Nvidia dont like being associated with them The description for the 5800x3d on there is the most neckbeard shit ive ever read on a website Honest to God my respect for amd would be so good if they did that But I think amd is confident enough that theyre a great alternative to their competitors and enough knowledgeable people know about the userbenchmark controversies that they probably wont take the time to sue Thing is that site comes up in like the top 3 search results whatever hardware query you make I legitimately think it has a tangible effect on the market share Weird that AMD isnt doing anything about it They are the only site on the internet that contains wellorganized easilyreadable comparision of hardware The data are garbage sure but presentation is perfect Besides the owner of that siting thinking amd has never made a product worth testing in their life just look at the 4060 review Its literally the only tech website review that paints the 4060 in a positive light Pls stop using this shit site unfortunately they are very good at manipulating the Google algorithm and they are always in the first few results when you google something like GPU x vs GPU y Steve from Gamers Nexus loves tearing a company apart with dirt Can somebody give him an idea for a story with this site It would be really nice to see all the negative publicity For reference a 4090 is able to hit above 70 from its average bench on userbenchmark without being marked as too extreme However a 7900 XTX can not even go past 50 from its 256 average score They are doing this to prevent the XTX from being too high end thus lowering the average score much more than it actually is First time buyers tempted to consider the RX 77007800 XT by AMDarmy of Advanced Marketing scammers youtube reddit twitter forums etc should be aware that AMD have a history of releasing benchmark busting heavily marketed sub standard products Although Nvidia4070 only offers comparable performance it has a broader feature set RTDLSS 30 and offers far better game compatibility drivers PC gamers looking to join AMDGPU club Steam stats 500060007000 series combined mkt share need to work on their critical thinking skills Influencers posing as reviewers are paid handsomely to scam users into buying inferior products Experienced gamers know all too well that high average fps are worthless when they are accompanied with stutters random crashes excessive noise and a limited feature set Morning brother youve missed quite a lot during your coma j In all seriousness tho theyve been doing this for years Yeah I know but to this degree is insane 20 decrease in average scores for the XTX because of this Even then its still the 2nd best scored card on the site so L to them Yeahnoticed this as well months ago after completing my new build This benchmarking site is crap They are about the most biased and nonagnostic comparison site I ever come across on the internet Take a look at their 7800x3D view Lol Rather than actually reviewing the tech they just go into a rant about how AMD is the worse company ever and anyone who says otherwise tech reviewers influencers etc  has been paid off by them LOL Seriously go check it out Super scummy Lmao look at their 7600 review They flat out say the 4060 is faster but their OWN WEBSITE shows the 7600 is literally faster in every way This site is more than a joke Jesus Christ Thats who userbenchmark needs right now When AMD started to beat Intel in benchmarks  they literally changed how they calculated the benchmarks so Intel would still be ahead in their rankings Usershillmark is well known for false information theyve been a discredited source for many years now when it was clear the data they were publishing for AMD devices was deliberately falsified or distorted to make them look worse than their true performance,-2
2023-09-14,"ASML is almost 16% down since May - why? I just don't get. Everywhere I look I hear 'Invest into ASML, its definitely undervalued, it will go up soon. Don't mind the short roll backs, it will pick up really quick'. No, it doesnt...It just keeps rolling backwards. Despite really strong data all across its balance sheet & portfolio. I don't get it. Should I sell? This is so discouraging... Is up 30% in 12 months and 237% in 5 years. Also, don't ever buy something based on hearing stuff from other people. Buy at the top and wonder why its down. Buy high sell low lol. People really be looking at monthly charts only Most commentary on stocks online is positive and biased. Hence looking ?쓊verywhere??does not give a accurate picture. My advice is: Don?셳 trust anyone or anything, because noone really knows. The mantra of ?쓉o your own research??that is taught to new investors unfortunatly does not say how to perform this research which results in people ending up in the echo chamber that is social media. I seemingly bought at the top. Down 19%. ?삎 I'll hold til I see green The US is dictating the NL to impose an embargo on China. That's what's happening. Wu Zetian has denounced you. By the tone of this post you clearly don't do enough due diligence and are now panicking. So let's break it down if there is reason to panic:  EUV machines produces light at 13.5 nanometers which is a wavelength more than 10x smaller than today's machines . Each machine needs more than 350k parts, costs between $150/200 million and the ones from 2024 will cost upward to $300/500m each . They are a result of 35 years of research and development, So now that we have covered how complex and high-end tech these machines are let's take a look at financials.  Free cash flow has been increasing over the years and revenue has increased more than 400% in the last 8 years . Net debt/EBITDA is negative meaning then company can pay off all the debt with just the cash & equivalents that it currently holds . The financials are rock solid not a single warning. Now valuation: it's not a cheap stock by any means, it has a 30 PE ratio and a Price to sale ratio of ~10 and 28 EV/EBITDA. It's not expensive either. It's a monopoly that has a premium attached, if it ever loses the premium then it's time to worry.  Geopolitical risks are real especially when ASML customers are counted by hand . TSMC HQ is in a country that could be in conflict with China at any point of time . Innovation and competition is also a concern although a concern to every company on earth . In conclusion, it's a stock that I personally dca below 600??and I would sell my kidney (joke) if it ever reaches 400??again. It is a solid company with risk like any other but deserves respect and a proper portfolio allocation. Don't listen to ads telling you how to invest. Did u see how much it?셲 gone up since the low or this year alone before this drop? It was $400 less than 12 months ago and went up 72.5% before current reversal. Also if u zoom out a bit more it drop 50% from ATH. So strap in, and DYOR so u won?셳 panic sell and double down instead if your research says it?셲 undervalued. INTC should be the shit that comes out of the ass The memes have gotten really weak Nerds I like that the resolution is so low the text is completely unreadable. Is INTC your personality type?

Awesome build sir ?紐?裕?$AMD What case is it? Fractal North! Rumored Switch 2 T239 chip is rumored to be in TSMC 5nm Node and at 2.6 GHZ clock based on some LinkedIn resumes Doctre81, being the GOAT as he always has, found this insightful info from some former Siliconus Employees that most probably worked on T239. 5NM Node, TSMC, 2.653 GHZ Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo31WY-dRGI LinkedIn finally being useful We can shut down the site now I love reading technology specifications for these leaks and pretending they have any meaning to me I've been able to gauge a very vague understanding by following these riumours. VERY vague, but still. It's interesting even if I don't understand it fully. This would definitely make sense if NVIDIA was going the Ampere + additional Lovelace features route for this particular Tegra. Take DLSS 3 Frame Generation for example. Given the availability of Ampere?셲 existing feature set, the actual additional on-die requirements would be newer 4th gen Tensor Cores and specialized dedicated hardware for the NVOFA (Optical Flow Accelerators, which are present on Ampere) for them to run with low overhead and relatively independent of the main compute engine.  I can definitely see Nintendo wanting to opt for something like this since the majority of this new system?셲 appeal this generation seems to be compatibility with modern games and game engines such as Unreal Engine 5 . If they go 5nm all the way there?  Nintendo usually doesn't go for the most cutting-edge tech ever since the Wii of course . But they have a relatively good reason to stick to at least relatively newer technology this generation in order to ensure this new system has legs as long as the original Switch . I like your funny words, magic man That title gave me a mild seizure A mild seizure at DLSS upscaled 1440p/60fps Ampere on the Orin is Samsung 8nm Ada on the Thor is TSMC 4nm. The Ryzen 7000 series is TSMC 5nm. Nvidia Tegra with an AMD GPU confirmed /s No really, there's a lot of conflicting discourse here. TSMC's 4 nm process node called ""4N"" is considered by the to be part of the 5 nm family and it's what Ada/RTX40 is based on. I'k still gambling that the real custom nature of the T239 (i.e. a single GPC with 1536 shader cores) is a old+new generation mashup featuring Ada. We saw something like with the Steam deck usings a last-generation SoC with a newer-generation GPU core. Food for thought: The full sized Ada GPU is 18,432 cores in 12 clusters. A single cluster is 1,536 shader cores. The T239 we know through linux documentation and the gigaleak, has a single cluster 1,536 shader core GPC. MAKES YOU THINK Don't put too much hope into this yet. Not 100% confirmed and the name from the email seems to be a common name so the LinkedIn profile could be a completely different person. Makes more sense than 8nm tho so I guess this theory has that going for it. Siliconus is from Bangalore and the name in the T239 email leak is also at the same place. It's circumstantial evidence but it's a nice connection none the less. I'm gonna try to explain the very basics of what flops mean so more people can put it into context and have an idea when they see these numbers. Flop stands for Floating Point Operation. Floating point is a decimal point, which well you know how when you are multiplying numbers with decimal points where the decimal point is can move In the end number? Right that's what Float means. An operation is like doing a math problem, like 12.5 x 32.78. So flops means math with decimals. The number after the flop, means the size the number that can be worked with can get, so fp16, means the numbers for the math problems and their solutions can have 16 digits so 1.234567891123456 X 1.234567891123456 So what the hell are things like that used for? Well, plotting a point in 3d space would require 3 high precision numbers for the X, (horizontal) Y (vertical) and Z (depth). Do three of those, and you can connect the dots to make a triangle. This, is a polygon, and the points are now called vertices.  Mario's standard model (with hat) from super Mario 64 has 780 of these polygons, made by 522 vertices . Arrange these triangles to look like a person or thing, and you have a 3d model . Just sliding Mario's model like a statue takes 31,320 flops for 60fps . This mario statue, has no colors, as we have not mapped any textures to it. There are a bunch of different methods for mapping textures, which are best used for certain cases, but we aren't going to get into any of that.  Using floating point math you can 'wrap' that texture around a 3d model, like a sticker, or map the texture . This has to be done many times a second like 30 times, or 60 times (or for some games 20 lol) to give the illusion of movement . Megaflop = 1 million flops. Gigaflop = 1 billion flops. Teraflop = 1 trillion flops. We reached Gflops with ps2 cube and Xbox for game consoles. We finally reached Tflops with ps4 and xbone.... For game consoles. Now we are reaching why shaders were called shaders to begin with. So you have your model, and you have your texture, what about lights and shadows?  Each texel on your texture will need to determine what angle the light is hitting it at, based on the direction the polygon face it's on is facing, the direction of the light, and the direction it's facing, to blend that light/dark value, the color of light and the texel from the texture together, or shade So the basic concept is more flops means more polygons for better looking models, more texels for better looking textures to wrap them with, and more light and shadows that can be put on them, and more in depth ways you can make them all move. Techboys, is this cool or nah? Simpler explanation Samsung 8nm = consumes more power so Nintendo will clock it less to maintain their target watts (15w I assume). The chip will also be big so I assume Nintendo will have to increase the size of the Switch significantly to accommodate.
TSMC 5nm = consumes less power so Nintendo can clock it high to maintain target watts All in all, it's free performance and you'll get a cooler device. Battery life depends on whether Nintendo will clock it too high or not. For mobile devices like the Switch, heat is a big issue. Is that good? It?셲 funny. We have our first Switch 2 controversy and the console hasn?셳 even been announced yet ?쁻. The real controversy would be if it uses 8nm. TSMC 4nm/5nm is a big step up in comparison and is more ideal. I assume the 2.653 GHz clock is for the CPU, that'd be a huge boost over Switch 1's almost 1GHz per core, not to mention it will have double the amount of cores too. With such a big CPU upgrade 60fps might be more common place again like in the Gamecube and Wii era. (At least for the 1st and 2nd party games)  Last time Nintendo made a console with cutting edge technology was a little over 2 decades ago . Even if this turns out to be true, i expect to see a straight up 2.040GHz clock per core (double of what Switch 1 has) with 2.653GHz being the theoretical ceiling .  TSMC 5nm node is definitely the most realistic scenario, i can't imagine Nintendo trying to fit a 12SM Ampere GPU in there with an 8nm node, but then again, it's Nintendo and i don't see them going after the most recent technology for their products . Maybe they somehow managed to fit it all in with Samsung At least there is no fanfiction about company values attached to this rumor.",4

2023-09-19,"Chart Im fine Rumors Suggest TSMC 2nm Mass Production May Be Delayed to 2026 Any idea how does TSMC 2nm compare to Intel 20A or 18A? According to Intel's projection, they will regain market leadership with 18A. They themselves believe that their 20A is not as good as TSMC 2nm. Parity at 2nm v 20A and leadership at 18A according to Intel. Likely they expect certain characteristics to be better at 20A, but no they won't hit most performance comparisons until 18A. 20 a is worse than 2NM from tsmc while 18A is on par or slightly better  N3B mass production was 2022 after all . This is not surprising considering how small these xtors are . TSMC is also adopting GAAFET for the 1st time . TSMC also lost hundreds of billions of dollars or are in the process of losing hundreds of billions of dollars of orders permanently from China. Their loss was masked by the covid semiconductor boom but now that things have calmed down AND China is seemingly coming online with their semiconductor industry in a competitive node, we will likely see a bust in both profit and rnd, and speed of node evolution in semiconductor supply chain based on american patents. Delaying a lot of nodes as of lately...After the subpar 3nm node it makes sense. Good. Need more competition and time for Intel to hand them a spanking back. Now Intel will have a great chance to land some serious customers for their foundry services. Pretty sure TSMC denied this rumor already Yea it's in the headline but honestly rumors are always true There's no chance. If they do very, very well, they will have a high yield N5/N4 competitor by then. Hoping for anything more than that with DUV, or a Chinese domestic EUV supplier, in only 3 years is a pipe dream. May i ask how? They dont hv euv machines. Unless they pull some trick from out of their sleeve How? They lack access to Extreme ultraviolent (EUV) lithography, which is the only feasible way to reach 2nm for high volume manufacturing. Additionally, there achievement of 7nm is reliant on semiconductor equipment from the west. These equipment sales are further being restricted.",0

2023-09-21,"Bullying LOL Buy ASML Their stock has been tanking since mid July, and recently TSMC announced a slowing of purchase orders for their equipment. However other chip producers (primarily Intel) are standing in line for their equipment. They have a solid balance sheet with more cash than debt with strong levered free cash flow. The forward P/E is very reasonable for a leading tech company of roughly 25. Although they are in the Euro Zone subject to unpredictable regulation & merger possibilities - no one is close to match their technological innovation at its present state let alone past them. The jury is out who will win the AI revolution, but whoever that may be can?셳 do it without ASML. ASML?셲 revenue & earnings growth will increase then accelerate over this decade. Current quarterly revenue growth is 27% (yoy). I see in doubling or quadrupling in the coming years. Buy and hold. TL;DR: ASML is a leading supplier of equipment for the semiconductor industry and is essential for the production of high density node chips. Their stock has been tanking recently but they have a solid balance sheet and strong levered free cash flow. Although they are in the Euro Zone, they are the only game in town for 4nm chips and beyond. Most AI workloads do not require the density of 4nm process nodes. *Training* maybe, but inference certainly does not. FPGAs and other memory crossbar like chip topologies are on larger process sized nodes, as is automotive and industrial applications, so... your thesis goes to shit right at bullet 1. Source: Chip designer. You should not overthink this; simply buy the dip. You are like a year or more late to the party ?쁾 Quarter of a trillion dollar company. Invest now! who the fuck is going to even buy from them, we know who ALL the purchasers are, the market knows who EVERY LAST PURCHASER is they can't produce faster, the purchasers can't produce faster, new purchasers don't exist unless ASML announces equipment that produce FASTER and charge WAY MORE for those, its dead simple to price everything in for this company unless the fabs actually follow through with any of their expansion plans, fucking, TOMORROW, then there's nothing more to buy from ASML. TSMC needs to turn the entire state of Arizona into a fab instead of just talking about it, and even then I'd still be skeptical if ASML can deliver enough value to make this be a long I want to take As computers get faster and more powerful, the software everyone runs on them becomes more complex. It's a never-ending growth cycle ATM, which exists to keep customers upgrading, so that all these companies can stay in business. Everyone saying computers aren't going to need more power in the future are dreaming. Innovation to drive sales will always be the norm. And in computers that will always involve higher power to run more complex software. ASML will keep making better machines and Intel, TSM, etc will keep buying them at whatever cost. Thought we were talking about A2M here for a second..... You are late son. This stock was close to 300 a few months ago. TSMC has asked vendors like ASML to delay orders. Highly likely this stock is headed back to mid 300s. You need to cut it with this buy high-sell low.  ASML have a wide moat and are the only company capable of producing 4nm chips and beyond . Their stock has been tanking recently but I believe this to be an opportunity to buy . ASML also has a solid balance sheet and forward P/E ratio . Yeah Visual MOD but does Michael Burry think? Buying some now! Good news Google also plans to launch an improved networking chip internally codenamed Granite Redux with chipmaker Marvell Technology by next year Here No posts verifying shareholders LOL If you fall here The market capitalization of 200 trillion won has been broken Its not going up walking in ones right place Samsung is probably going to plummet tomorrow LOL Wow hahaha a great bubble",2

Bitcoin's greatest fat-finger ever. Offchain media picked up the story and the reaction was as you expect, Bitcoin's dangerous! One mistake can be costly; no recourse."""" Sadly, they stopped reporting and would provide almost no coverage for the story's end. Chances are, many of you don't know it either. Stakefish's F2 Pool returned 19.8 BTC to Paxos five days later. They didn't have to, but acted with integrity. Stakefish founder, Chun Wang, immediately announced that the fat-fingered user had 72 hours to claim a refund from them. The user allowed the 72 hours to expire. Paxos approached Chun well after the 3-day refund window. The pool returned the excess BTC. We want Bitcoin to succeed. Personally, I consider they made the right choice. Although I confess I'm not sure I could have myself. We want folks to feel confident when using it. A refund was no doubt an excruciatingly difficult choice, but perhaps it makes sense for the network's long-term success, which benefits you and me. But maybe I'm in the minority; what do you think? Evidently, even Chun's conflicted. That miner must be a Shaolin monk to return that amount but the difficult choice was the right one Truly based I know many here would not do that (i'm speaking for myself). Right choice no doubt, but I don't think I have it in me to have done the same. Paxos was granted 72 hours to make claim. Imagine how excited they were when the clock ran out. Then two days later they had to give it back anyway. Amazing to see people are not so greedy in this space This was a pool, not a solo miner so their reputation would be ruined in a way Sadly this aspect of the story received no coverage. Fair play to the pool for returning it, I wouldn't have blamed them at all if they kept it. In fact, I'd probably have distributed it to the miners if it were my decision.

2023-09-28,"AMD FSR 3 Now Available It is recommended to use AMD FSR 3 with VSync as when enabled frame pacing relies on the expected refresh rate of the monitor for a consistent highquality gaming experience Additionally it is recommended that Enhanced Sync is disabled in AMD Software Adrenalin Editionsettings as it can interfere with frame pacing logic A game using AMD FSR 3 in this configuration will show a gzagpattern on frame time timing graphs in performance measuring tools such as AMD OCAT This is completely expected and does not indicate uneven frame pacing FSR 3 can also be used with VSync disabled for example for performance measurement but the experience will be less optimal due to frame tearing inherent to not having VSync enabled Is if ok if use and freesync of my monitor instead of vsync This official statement appears to solve on the vsync settings for better experience as some other topics were already debating Good for AMD to provide more detailed info in a single piece Tried it out and was pleasantly surprised how well it worked on my 6600xt Oh So it does recommend to disable Enhanced Sync and enable Vsync Thats why I was having issues with Forspoken Now I want to see comparison between FSR3 and DLSS 3 on Immortals of Aveum EDIT Idk why but enabling Vsync on Forspoken Native AA  FG made it worse I turned it off instead EDIT 2 Enabling driver Vsync instead of ingame Vsync works properly Forspoken Native AA  FG is much much smoother even when I am on grass at 80fps The Immortals implementation of DLSS FG was so buggy that I had to disable it I canremember having that issue in any other game sounless they fix that with the same FSR3 patch I wouldnget your hopes up for a good comparison I want it on cyberpunk now Meanwhile Im still waiting for FSR 2 in Baldurs Gate 3 AMD How about Freesync Because normally I use freesync and not vsync And I think there are more ppl out there like me Bring on starfield fsr3 mods lol Last night only 11 people were playing Immortals 61 people played Forspoken yesterday night Such weird game choice to unveil something potentially big What was marketing smoking Part of me thinks the tech isngood with how they tried rolling this under the rug on launch Well looks like more of a tech demo than a full tech reveal To be honest the current game selection itself doesnt matter if the tech is good enough It will eventually come to other games  What was marketing smoking The same smoke that made nvidia start dlss with control none because they worked on a title they had easier access and thats it You have to think of this as a technical preview and a proofofconcept edit gamers missing the point getting up in arms Please change ramd they testing if its flawed they will look silly in a big release Just tested it on my system Forspoken Demo free on steam Win11 7800x3d 32gb ddr5 ram 7900xtx 3440x1440p Native is 50 fps with full RT Quality FRS 3 with frame gen 170fps Didnt notice too much input lag tried a controller and m kb didnt feel that normal chug when flipping 180 Turned off vsync because its a 120hz monitor I saw surprisingly no screen tearing For something not using any proprietary tech it is surprisingly good and even if it was its still really impressive Somewhere between 65 and 85 FPS at standard settings without RT at 1440p on my 6700 XT using FSR at Balanced Over 110 FPS at all times when Frame Generation is turned on I found using Radeon Chill to limit FPS to 120 got rid of some minor frame pacing as a result of no VRR mainly and its buttery smooth now The new tive AANative AntiAliasing quality mode applies highquality antialiasing and sharpening without any upscaling for improved image quality over native resolution There is a modest performance cost when using this new mode but when combined with frame generation tive AAmode can provide enhanced image quality and a boost in framerate How modest are we talking about AMD because personally I couldnt care less about FG On a 6700 XT 49 FPS with Native AA and then 52 FPS with native resolution and TAA So comparitive to TAA about 6 Theres also SMAA which went to 53 and FXAA which went to 54 and this remained the same for no AA at all 1440p standard settings high model memory and high texture memory no RT Is there an advantage of using FSR on an AMD card compared to an Nvidia none but AMD will implement fluid motion at a driver level soon which will support all dx11dx12 games Its been out already for half an hour and we still dont have an hour long detailed micro analysis smh AMD did show a tech demo to DF so Im surprised they werent granted earlyaccess Kind of odd IKR I dont know what to do with myself
Please Alex hurry up Ill be very interested to see the Digital Foundry video breakdown on this Its really head scratching to me that Starfield wasnt their headline game to demonstrate this Its kinda weird they dont already have a preview Did any media outlet get an early look at FSR3 or does everyone just get to play with it today I think Starfield had their hands full fixing other stuff like missing stars P Tried it with forspoken demo on my 3060ti and now i need it in Cyberpunk Did not expect it to be that decent but I must say that quality preset with rt and fg gave me about 8090fps and minimal input lag Honestly the added input lag was really really noticeable going from 7080 fps So glad I can finally run frame gen and confirm what I thought would be true 3060fps frame gen feels great on a controllerTV set up where input lag is not a huge deal It feels bad when not perfectly paced tho so VRRGsync feels bad but a perfectly locked 60 feels great AMDMSBGS should seriously try and ship a 60fps frame gen mode for Starfield on Series X I tried it on Forspken demo on a 2070 mobile just a little The addition to visual smoothness was evident  IQ seemed decent Fsr already artifacts more than dlss Just like in videos online frametime graph becomes a thick bar frame pacing felt somewhat uneven Overall Turing gpus should easily benefit from it at 1080p Once its found how to employ it along dlss and reflex Keeping the latency reducer locked behind fsr3 is slimmy They should expose it like reflex does Latency reducer should be optional in menu regardless of FG Not gonna lie this seems really good in Forspoken Im using a 3080 at 1440p output resolution with a 60fps vsync native cap and using FSR2 Performance all FSR presets look bad here just using it for testing and Im getting a locked 120fps output with really good feeling responsiveness and good visuals minus the issues brought by FSR upscaling I dont have a DF level of micro benching analysis tools and visual acuity analyses but for a first outing of this sort of vendor agnostic tech Im left actually quite impressed and I never thought I would say that I figured this would be some thrown together Nvidiacopycat stuff but Im shocked My big complaints are The FG part of FSR3 should not lock out DLSS Super Resolution I hope this isnt an AMD mandate for games that feature FSR3 FG FSR3 upscaling looks very bad in Forspoken at any preset so that kinda diminishes the overall experience for FSR3 FG You kinda have to cap the game at a certain framerate not sure if vsync is required But thats what I would recommend for an Nvidia user I capped to 60 with vsync enabled just for this testing It can have some issues when tabbing out and tabbing back in I have to repeatedly enter the pause menu and exit again for it to trigger again It seems to be very much in a varies by machine state right now I cant always get it to work properly and Im seeing many people and tech reviewers encountering issues What works for me is full screen with vsync enabled at a 60 fps cap Sometimes the game will disable FSR3FG randomly but if i hit the escape key twice quickly it will reenable itself To answer any framepacing questions the framepacing is fine for some reason RTSS doesnt play well with FSR3 FG So it makes the frametimes look awful It feels very smooth but I hope RTSS can be updated to interface correctly with this if possible Please let me know if anyone has any questions Im going to be looking at this all afternoon probably I cant test actual input latency numbers so keep that in mind Looks like FSR3 also works with Nvidia 20xx and 30xx cards and presumably 40xx series cards as well  Nice Well as long as the card has dedicated async compute units Even old Polaris and Pascal cards can push FG at least in theory Though FG has a set cost regardless of the available shader  FP horsepower so Im assuming the performance will actually degrade on these old cards with minimal async compute Just a wild guess The problem with frame gen is the expectations I doubt it will ever look good at terrible base fos At 5060fps base it could be very useful Well if you are have to play at 30fps you are gonna be easier to please All these forum warriors are out here mad about frame gen and Im just thinking How the fuck else are we going to hit 4k240 or 8k120 in the next 45 years without it Its just a tool and one Im sure glad we have now My 3080 life increased thank you AMD No ghosting no UI corruption works with vsync Works on tons of Nvidia GPUs Much better launch than DLSS3 AMD Software Adrenalin Edition Preview Driver for AMD Fluid Motion Frames Release Notes New Feature Highlights AMD Fluid Motion Frames AFMF Technical Preview Boost FPS with frame generation technology for a smoother gaming experience AFMF adds frame generation technology to DirectX11 and 12 games on AMD RadeonRX 7000 Series Desktop Graphics AFMF preserves image quality by dynamically disabling frame generation during fast motion What to know AMD Fluid Motion Frames AFMF AFMF can be automatically enabled using HYPRRX or toggled individually using the Global Graphics Settings page for these select titles A Plague Tale  Requiem Borderlands 3 Control Dead Space Deep Rock Galactic Dying Light 2 Far Cry6 Ghostwire Tokyo Hitman 3 Hogwarts Legacy Horizon Zero DawnMetro Exodus Enhanced Edition Red Dead Redemption 2 Resident Evil 3 Resident Evil 4 Shadow Of The Tomb Raider Star Wars Jedi SurvivorStarfield The Last of UsPart 1 The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt In addition to these select titles AFMF may be manually enabled for any title such as Cyberpunk 2077 using the perapp settings within AMD Software Adrenalin Edition The AFMF technical preview currently requires the game to be played in fullscreen mode with HDR disabled and VSYNC disabled For the optimal experience AFMF is recommended to be used on AMD FreeSyncdisplays Users are recommended to disable HDR in Windows Display Settings or disable HDR in the game as well as AutoHDR AFMF features an activity monitor similar to AMD Radeon Super Resolution to confirm the frame generation status using AMD Software Adrenalin Editioningame overlay use the default hotkey of AltR for the fullscreen overlay or AltZ for the sidebar overlay AFMF can introduce additional latency in games and is recommended to be combined with AMD RadeonAntiLagAntiLag for the optimal experience As AFMF may introduce additional latency in games AFMF may not offer the optimal experience in fastpaced competitive titles AFMF is recommended to be enabled for games running at a minimum fps of 55 FPS for 1080p displays and 70 FPS for 1440p or above displays Known Issues Intermittent driver crashes have been observed while AFMF is enabled and the games resolution is changed or a task switch happens such as alttab between different windows Brief corruption may be observed when switching between windows with AFMF enabled on some 144Hz or greater monitors Brief stutter may be experienced after closing the Xbox Game Bar FreeSyncdisplays may report an erratic FPS when AFMF is enabled Some metrics such as frame time may show inconsistent results when AFMF is enabled so I cannot use any of this with my 6700XT just to confirm Thats interesting that this preview is out so early My guess is they want as much data from users as possible so its as good as possible at the real launch This solved my issue with Adrenalin not opening I installed twice back to back without reseting for what is worth first one popped some weird error messages edit had my first BSOD in a year on pc wake up Be warned High Idle Power fixed for me finally 20w with dual monitor 1440165hz 1080144hz Hopefully someone can mod the driver and enable Frame Gen for 6000 series cards Im sure its just a Hardware ID check since FSR3 had no trouble running on many generations of GPUs on Forspoken Amd has really stepped up the game with their software department Lately driver releases have been very freguent improvements with upscaling have been very good especially now with FSR3 and FG big steps ahead with ROCm and now this months before than originally announced I dont know what they have done but those actions are very welcome Tried with starfield on some random moon 7900xtx 4k highest settings fsr off 7580fps without 130140fps with FMF But it feels slower with it micro stutters are there plus I can feel that extra latency and Im playing with gamepad vsync ingame and enhanced sync are off Meh Ill stick to playing without it for now Edit visible artifacts in new Atlantis while walking super visible on ads Works when enabling for cyberpunk However once you get down below 60ish FPS game gets very blurry in motion 7900xtx went from about 7080 all maxed ultra RT to 130ish with frame gen But again if the frames dip IQ gets pretty jarring this driver doesnt have the adrenalin panel for me  Pls help me my config   i7 13700k  32GB DDR5 6600mhz CL32  Sapphire RX 7900 XTX Nitro Vapor On windows 10 PRO last ver I do DDU and i try the amd tool too Its very tood but why cant they support 6000 series Its a technical preview maybe wait for them to release a stable version before older GPUs are supported AMD says Fluid Motion Frames is compatible with most modern AMD and Nvidia GPUs Theres no word on Intel GPUs but in principle Intels Arc graphics should be able to run Fluid Motion Frames In practice it may be more complicated and depend on factors like latency reduction For the record these are the GPUs AMD has thus far listed
AMD
Radeon RX 5700 onwards supported
Radeon RX 6000series onwards recommended
Nvidia
GeForce RTX 20series onwards supported
GeForce RTX 30series onwards recommended Looks like its a driverside implementation of Frame Gen If its natively supported by the game it can be used by older cards But driverside frame gen looks like its only for newer cards for now which they said during the announcement a month earlier The fact that they are releasing the beta for AFMF this early tells me they must have done a pretty good job on the happy path performancequality Im crazy excited to upgrade to 240Hz now Nvidia on suicide watch if FMF can really drop in to most games Why would you get an NV card now besides memeing about DLSS being better in its handful of games Gonna be a ton of games with RT and no DLSS FG where AMD is slower in RT except then you turn on FMF and users would ABX the slower Radeon card almost every time Canwait to play Hitman 3 Hogwarts Legacy Horizon Zero DawnMetro Exodus Enhanced Edition sounds like a aaaa title In Forspoken FSR3 felt bad despite showing high fps depending on configuration in with fluid motion in The Last Of Us part 1 its a noticeable difference kinda curious now tho since fluid motion disengages at fast movement does this also apply on FSR3 cos that would explain why it felt like less fps altho it still reported frame doubling when moving camera fast No 6000 series Dang doesnt seem to work for Elden Ring Shame as thats a 60fps locked game Edit Elden Ring works if you use the unlock framerate mod even if set to 60 Tried in cyberpunk felt worse but the microstutter rate  was 100 in the overlay Switch it off and the  went down to 0 Think I have something messing it up Ah Im upset  Its sold so fast Amd video was surprising I cant believe that the Radeon Linux drivers are so much better then the Windows ones Its the opposite of Nvidias situation with drivers Probably because the Linux drivers are open source so third partys like Redhat IBM do a lot of the debugging There are 2 versions of the AMD driver for Linux to be nice and confusing but thankfully its actually pretty simple AMDVLK is the bad one always go with mesa I am running AMD and certainly dont have anywhere near the number crashes as they do if at all Its almost like people can have gasp different experiences with hardware I cant help but blame Luke for his issues dude needs to get a new power supply A bad one can definitely cause crashes while gaming Got 2 friends both have the 6900xt No issue for one of them constant crashing for the other The inconsistency is unreal But one thing seems to be conclusive The issue lies with Discord Another friend got 7900xtx on my advice and i have only seen him on Discord a handful of times since then since he cant play most games without crashing when discord is active he plays mostly single player games anyway so its whatever Amd and nvidia linux drivers switch positions every decade it is the strangest thing AMD was comparable when they had a higher market share like a decade ago but they always had issues with launch drivers not being up to snuff Aged like fine wine stopped being charming when their products got worse But they always cared about Linux and its true that low market share means less software optimization Nvidia Linux drivers always sucked for anything but virtualizationcompute That almost always worked fine but they did not care about anything else General drivers were communitymade and reverseengineered Then they got hacked and were forced to opensource their drivers ever since its been sunhine and rainbows amdgpu is a goodsend But even on Linux its usually better to wait a few month after a release before you buy the shiniest amd gpu it seems that was the biggest problem they had they started their challenge with the press release drivers tbh i have still high hopes for intel i love my intel arc 370 in my nas only does media encoding it really works well and on linux we dont need old directx support as it is already mapped to vulkan or opengl anyway I have 6950 xt and even tho my driver experience is worse than my experience with Nvidia Its still far better than LTT experience I think their problems are related to 7900 xt specifically and the fact they tried only few early drivers i guess does not excuse AMD Nah I have a 6900xt and my ride has not been smooth at all In fact just posted a whole lotta text here on ltt on every issue Ie found which appear to be pretty common Also the fact that they never restart or shutdown their computer causes TONS of issues regardless of GPU I work IT and the amount of times a computer just works correctly after a restart is astronomically the 1 fix to IT issues to any other troubleshooting I did love the format to this video It felt real not a scripted staged video where its just going to shockfun factor Just honest opinions on their experiences Yeah I was surprised Im running Hyprland as my window manager in arch and my 7900xtx has had 0 issues I figured it could only be infinitely more stable for them than on anything Im running Yeah thats what Ive always been saying thats why I always said that installing windows on the steam deck didnt give any performance benefits since you were losing the amazing community made drivers that linux has Anyone else think the pacing or editing or something about this video was just weird It was kinda hard to follow what was going on who was having what issues and if theyve been resolved or not or what was causing them It may be an older video that wasnt released yet i am full amd rig right now and last 4 years i have 0 issues at all i dont know where lukes especially so called issues even comes from once more if you criticise drivers why ltt is completely shut their mouth when it comes to nvidia issues and especially silent on nvidia driver overhead issue i am not a fanboy of any company it just pisses me off when ltt once more applies double standards i am full amd rig right now and last 4 years i have 0 issues at all And thats great Different people have different experiences and sometimes you get great results i dont know where lukes especially so called issues even comes from Woah Whats with the aggro there Lukes issues were shown in the video Theyre not so called issues theyre observable issues once more if you criticise drivers why ltt is completely shut their mouth when it comes to nvidia issues and especially silent on nvidia driver overhead issue Theyre not They have spoken about the issues in depth before Hell even in this video that was entirely about AMD stuff Jake and Luke mentioned that nvidias drivers treat you like shit i am not a fanboy of any company it just pisses me off when ltt once more applies double standards I think you need to take a chill pill duderino Theyre not applying double standards This was a video explicitly about AMD cards and their experience with AMD kit It would make no sense to start laying into nvidia in a video about AMD Earnings Surprise Sales and operating profits exceeding expectations Now Q1

Im going to take a look at yesterdays drop in the free market I think hes recovering The AMD experience on CS2 the worst is when it keeps running at full speed when u freeze and cannot stop it for 23 secs fell off vertigo twice because of this lol This is a result of Shader Compilation After every AMD driver update and occasionally every CS2 update these stutters occur To solve it you would have to just play a round or so on each map shooting every single gun throwing every single nade to allow for shaders across differenct scenarios to compile then it will be smooth in normal gameplay Hopefully this issue can be addressed because it is super annoying to have to do this tedious manual process of forcing shaders to compile before having a smooth experience EDIT httpswwwredditcomrGlobalOffensivecomments16v83igcommentk2pzcjuutmsourceshareutmmediumweb2xcontext3
Check details in this comment seems to have fixed the stuttering from my side at least I am using NAVI DX9 with regular DX11  This seems to be an AMD 6000 series and above only fix Thanks uapoq  Instead of exploring the whole map you can try disabling DXNAVI which has worked for others httpsredditcomrGlobalOffensivesRQ10JowfFa httpsredditcomrAMDHelps89Gu7Jq46y Im having something like it and Im using a RTX 3050 Sometimes when something new happens like the first AWP shot of the game my game freezes for a second EDIT just happened again the first time I zoomed in with an AWP in a game shaders should be compiled before getting in to the game even if it takes longer we want less lag and stutters There is a big thread regarding this issue here httpswwwredditcomrGlobalOffensivecomments16ugv8ipsaforamdgpuuserslaunchingthegameforthe Read the advise on OPs post and the issue should disappear just keep in mind when upgrading  reinstalling GPU drivers I had SOME similar stutters on my setup AMD CPU and a Nvidia GPU Still probably shaders just saying its not only AMD LOL now Windows has formerly Linux problems that were solved years ago haha Shader Compilation not done inadvance This happens on Nvidia cards as well Both myself and my friend have a 4090 and we get microstuttersmicrofreezes I had this issue in CSGO as well and it happened before I got this card on 2080s on an old PC on 3090s on a different PC and this PC with a 4090 It doesnt happen as bad as in the video feels like its around 100ms stutter but it is noticeable and its the only game I experience this issue in Thoughts on AMD video an AMD owner experience Unfortunately as an AMD user I more on Luke side tbh Ie been rocking a 6900XT for a while now coming from an RTX 2080 before I used to have a 5600xt when it launched and 6 months after but swapped it due to driver problems Here is my take for anyone considering AMD after that video My experience after about 6 months on 6000 series The software features on the drivers are not very useful As they said on the video Freesync breaks stuff Stuttering crashes frame drops the whole package Not only freesync Enhanced sync causes massive stuttering or doesnt work at all unlike fast sync from Nvidia Radeon Boost looks like crap most of the time Radeon chill can cause crashes Radeon antilag and Image Sharpening are the only ones that dont cause trouble FSR is very unstable shimmery as hell very distracting Onscreen metrics apparently cap FPS to screen refresh rate and I have had a few multihour gaming sessions recorded thru the software with no screen popup telling me 70gb video files yikes 2 High idle power and mem Clock speed This is caused due to the display monitor timings in radeon software causing high idle power and max mem clocks at all times Gotta switch it from CVT to CVT reduced blanking via crating a custom resolution profile Or reduce screen refresh rateresolution AMD says its normal I say thats BS 3 Hard crashes needing a full unninstall and reinstall of drivers Some hard crashes require a full DDU and reinstallation of the drivers Happened to me just today with CS2 it appears to not be an isolated issue Witcher 3 Cyberpunk The Last of US and synthetic benchmarks can trigger this tooApparently windows installs its own graphic drivers on top of AMDs corrupting them This has been a problem for a while now Only fix disable automatic windows updates 4 Temps voltage gpu clocks AMD treats each gen of cards differently in their radeon software 5000 series had a custom curve utility very detailed 6000 series has only a voltage offset power cap and and minmax clock selector Had to heavily undervolt my 6900xt due to temps put thermal putty and PTM7950 so absolute overkill and still bad With radeon I had to cap my clock to 2200mhz at 1120mv so under the advertised boost clock With Hydra OC I can run it at 1050mv at 2500mhz Way lower temps than stock I shouldnt have to do this to reach the advertised clocks Cant say anything about 7000 tho but AMD leaves a lot of performance on the table 5 Game support is meh As I said before some games simply crash CS2 with its drivers crashes random 1 game on mirage no problem Second game also on mirage crash upon joining No fix yet Titanfall 2 falls to 2 fps upon certain screen effects appearing Tarkov loves to lag randomly which didnt happen on my way slower and vram equipped 2080 Witcher 3 loves to stutter not amd related and due to enhanced sync not working you just gotta live with it or live with tearing And like this many examples Baldurs Gate 3 crashed on both AMD and Nvidia though after some patches I keep crashing and my friends with Nvidia dont None of this issues are related to my Undervolt as I always test stock when I have problems TLDR For anyone who is considering AMD PLEASE BE READY TO TINKER It is an awesome piece of hardware if you are willing to spend the time finetuning your specific card solving its issues in exchange for great raster performance for the price No RTX no pretty upscaling FSR is not that good believe me no fast sync no ray reconstruction no NVENC NO PLUG N PLAY Just pure brute force at a decent price And a lot of headaches My specs for anyone wondering my card is not defective BTW Tested another one for a while same stuff Gigabyte 6900xt Gaming OC no problem listed is exclusive to gigabyte model Ryzen 5 5600B450 Aorus Elite ver 1xxCoolerMaster 1050 MWE Gold V2Noctua NHD15 IK overkill LianLi Lancool 215 with lots of noctuas Audio coming out through Audio interface IK there are some AMD gpu related problems with audio but I dont use it so cant say Bottom Text Glad to see constructive criticism on amd cards Sometimes I feel like people disinform others by literally worshipping amd on pcmr Ive seen many people recommend amd gpus and saying something along the lines drivers work flawlessly nowadays only downside is no dlss drivers work flawlessly nowadays only downside is no dlss Yeah because thats usually the case To be fair I dont use Windows often but when I do everything is flawless Ive never had any issue with my 6700XT since I first used it in December 2022 Yup I see the same issue pretty much across the board when it comes to the loud minority of consumers online We have about 80 workstations where I work and we run ASUS Nvidia cards on every single one of them We swap stuff around often to test things out for the stuff were developing and without fail ASUS Nvidia is the only one that has had less than 5 failures in the last 20 years Idk I just bought a 6650 XT and worked pretty much out of the box The first driver I installed was a good one and had no problems since I even undervolted it a bit to get it running more efficiently but at the same performance Yeah I built a 6750xt system for a friend recently 280 bucks for the card brand new Just made sure to fix any problems I knew the fix for upon setup At the price AMD is unbeatable in performance for sure but its a gamble on wether your ride is rocky or not Interesting that youve had so many issues I have a asrock 6900 XT and the only game Ive really had trouble with is MW2 A couple things are finicky like the AMD version of shadowplay not working all the time and resetting overclocks every time I update but for the most part Ive been pretty problem free Bought 6900XT no problems at allI have the feeling numerate all things that can happen but most likely will not is throwing a darker shadow on the brand than reality looks likeYeah you can explain about power drain clocks and everythingbut dude these infos are available before you buy the product and doesnt limit the function On the other hand I really love Radeon Chill SAM and the overall look and feel of the driver software You speak of game support and your first example is a beta game that just got a halfass release where people were still complaining about overall stability issues in the beta100 hours in BG3 without any crash Had a problem with my RAM what led to constantly crashing of everything including the GPU drivers Never needed a reinstall in weeksDont know what brought you to do this Im not saying I am completely objective and for me aswell for OP theres always the problem with extrapolating personal experiencesBut this is not more than a heavily subjective opinion piece and doesnt reflect the LTT video at all 67xx 580 6700xt Only issue Ive had in the whole time was apex legends sometimes hated my 580 But that was at the same time nv owners couldnt play either Its really odd how some people have no issues and others have loads If I was having that many issues with my PC Id be reinstalling windows I dont understand what I am doing wrong I have NEVER had issues with AMD hardware except for having to run a curve correction on my 7600x because it wanted to run constantly at 95 degrees Everything has run flawlessly for me I switched from a rtx 3070 to rx 7900xt and i never had any of the problems minus one problem with Firefox I use freesync in every game and have no problems with it Radeon Boost is not for most games its for FPS games like CS or Apex  games that dont need to look good FSR is not unstable is it on the same lvl as Dlss No But to my knowlege it is only a software solution not like Dlss  if im wrong pls correct me  Dlss has the same problems or with the addition of RR ghosting in 2077 My RTX 3070ti had extrem high clocks and idle power  200w with 2 1080p screens the bug never got fixed before i switched On both sides never had somthing like this Cant speak for the older cards but my rx 7900xt uses a uv and is close to 6070c the only problem i have is that my hot spot is to hot for my taste somtimes 30c higher but its mostly bc of the paste of my xfx card I have zero problems with any games bc of my card most of the time it was the game that was the problem Extrem modded skyrim Hogwarts Legacy  crashes in cutscenes but thats a problem of the game CS2  Satisfactory Elden Ring Monster Hunter and even emulation had zero problems I cant speak for everyone but i had exactly one bug and that was the firefox bug i mentioned nothing more than this and if you count the high idle power but that got fixed and i usually have a higher power draw bc i use a 4k wallpaper from wallpaper engine I had a 6700XT for two months and have not experienced a single crash It works pretty well for me Sort of relevant Last year I was looking for a second hand GPU and really wanted to go AMD but just knowing what to look for or buy was a minefield Their naming conventions to me just dontdidnt make sense So I purchased a 2060 knowing its exact generation and what to expect when it comes to performance I had the cash and was eager to get the card but knowing what to buysearch for just put me off Im going to make my next card AMD now Im going AMD hopefully tomorrow when my processor shows up How are naming conventions aby different for NVIDIA 6700 XT is the same thing as 3070 Ti when it comes to naming Im running a rtx2070 and an I77800k Im always telling myself that my setup is old but I never ever had any issues or crashes that so many are telling If Im one day upgrading Im ready to pay the premium to avoid those headaches Installing hardware is fine But Ive no patience to play around crashes I find my self having less problems with out the radeon utility installed and just using asus armory crate to update drivers but I have a 7900 xtx tuf oc and its a lot more stable I had a lot of the issues you discussed with the 6000 series gpus 6750xt and rx 580 for a while Only issue I have is having freensync on my other monitor Caused OBS and other things to stop updating when i go back to my main monitor Solution was to turn off freesync just for that monitor But this was fixed with a driver update probably a year or two ago Now everything runs fine and I even have an undervolt running I wouldnmind going amd again I do want better ray tracing performance though but thatonly for a few games that I have 6900xt XfX with zero problems 22w on idle with single monitor4K27 37w with the 2nd 1080p running But clock speed doubles when I run the 2nd might be my only complaint I guess 980mhz to 1988mhz I bought my first completely AMD laptop last November ryzen 9 5980hxradeon rx 6800m 12 times a month the gpu poops out and cant be detected I disabled windows 11 gpu driver updates but this didnt help In order to fix the problem I have to boot into safe mode use the AMD driver removal tool and reinstall AMD drivers I never had to do anything like this when I was using intelnvidia I dont see myself going AMD again after this experience and I wont recommend it to my family or friends who are even less tech savvy than I am I dont know what Im doing wrong D I would like to give my 2ct about 2 The issue really lies within the timings used by the manufacturers of the screens you look at Let me grab my MSI ming Monitoras an example The mag274qrfqd MSI is using some atrocious non standard timings on that screen so using it with any other screen that is not the exact same results in a raised base clock If I change the timings used with CRU to a standard one the base clock is low again AMD did explain why this happens in the past which I canfind anymore Like a more technical explanation This issue is also apparent on NVIDIA GPUs afaik Maybe they fixed that somehow with a fancy algorithm that does magic But to give a TLDR when the timings of the screens are not in sync the graphics card still needs to try to send l the dataand to overcome any potential desynchronisation with one of the screens screen goes blank it just ups the clock As an Nvidia user I dont even remember when was my last crash or graphics problem Thats my take intc on the approach to nashville last night a waypoint appeared that split the flight plan in two it read ntcwhich i assumed meant to intercept the waypoint that i wanted to go for heading so i do just that and once i am back on the purple line i click vnav and lnav back on but the ntcis still the next waypoint mind you it 90nm in a complete opposite direction of the airport that right in front of me and after many attempts of trying to input the next waypoint on the fmc over the intc waypoint i kept receiving the nvalidmessage so that sucked and confused me enough to come here to ask and plead for answers from any of you guys here Can really help much without knowing which plane you were

2023-09-29,"Deadlands Finale Amat Victoriae Curam Thoughts on the Deadlands finale and Deadlands as a whole SPOILERS FOR WHOLE SERIES 1 Andy as a GM is a bit more cerebral than Johnny or Luke he interspaces more theming with Biblical names such as Gethsemane to highlight his villains I dont see it as a good or bad thing although it was a very good thing when he never let it overpower the story While I saw Victoria coming as a villain and I saw the Four Horsemen theme coming I never saw her as Conquest that was a genuine good twist 2 I think it took a hot second for Johnny to grow into Nate When it came to comic relief you typically used Silas whereas Delacy provided that id factor of just blowing some dudes throat out but when Nate worked Nate worked well 3 Edie was excellent and really showed us how powerful she could be Ellens affectation of her accent really helped sell her character 4 Garnet was pretty good although I do feel like her solo moment in the duel was a little weaker I suppose with a Harrowed there you cant really use the same manitou thing again She was at her best when she was a person of mass destruction 5 Jasper did great things as a guest He integrated seamlessly into the narrative and worked together with the groups Most amateur guests tend to hog the spotlight since theyre only around once but he knew exactly what he was doing I wish theyd continue the series The concept of making most episodes two parters really highlighted the strength of Blades and amplified it They could even bring in more characters given Andys clever use of Christian theming using a Blessed would probably work well Im intrigued by the setting made and hope it continues I wasnt really sold on Deadlands at first I really enjoyed the first few but I found myself less interested as the group split up as I think Oxventure shines best when all of them are together However I still enjoyed it But this finale absolutely sold me entirely on it it made the whole series retroactively click for me and I cant wait to revisit the series in podcast form once theyre all up Andy is a terrific writer and while I agree with others that he wasnt perhaps as quick on his feet as Johnny of course he wasnt  its his DM debut I think he absolutely smashed it and I hope we see him DM again I thought Andy did phenomenally And its hilarious to me to have a situation where Andys getting criticized even mildly for not being as quick on his feet as possible Andys so quick in all the things they do live I appreciated the effort Andy and the team went through It wasn for me but I hope deadlands game fans loved it I glad Andy got the chance to lead a game Andy was a tremendous DM Between him Luke and Johnny he felt the most natural in the role as if hed been doing it for years It was also the biggest change in character for him as hes usually a lot less serious I do have to admit Johnny is at a disadvantage here because I am unfamiliar with BOTD en deadlands and thus wont notice when Luke or Andy make a mistake whereas I definitely notice when Johnny gets something wrong It could also just be personal bias as Andys style is closest to my own Really enjoyed the series and Andy as DM Not sure if hes done it off camera but if not he did a great job for a first time DM He put a lot of work into building the world and story and it really showed I think him keeping the story very linear was a benefit to it as opposed to the open world jazz DMing that Johnny tends to operate mostly because of the Oxventure Guild themselves One thing I would have liked to have seen was more backstory for the characters themselves We only really got into Edie monster hunter dead brother and Nates backstories gravedigger had a wife and this could be remedied in further playthrough Some questions Id like to see answered I might have missed if they answered them What happened during Silass law days Did he serve in the war Who was the horse that hurt him Why is Delacey a child traveling the country alone Who taught him how to shoot How did Garnet get her powers How does she deal with cheats Also big props to Jasper Came right in and fit really well excellent improv Would love to see the character pop up again maybe with a big favor to get Delacey out of his contract Overall really enjoyed it My favorite moment was when Garnet Silas and Nate were on trial Very big Three Stooges vibes from that whole interaction with the judge The best scene i find from Johnny was his DM insight into the game as a player and totally wreckin himself inside his brain httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvPHRqrDslRXIt4672s  laughed so hard at his expressions and talk xD Their I loved it They have such chemistry and charisma I really hope to see them again regardless whether its the same setting or a different one It worked pretty well didnt it I did feel like Garnet got dealt a poor hand in the finale  I suspect that after defeating the Famine ghoul she was probably supposed to regain her power access but Andy didnt seem to mention that so she ended up injured and without anything much to contribute to the last battle How to temporarily remove agency from a character for plot reasons without being too frustrating for the player is a really tricky balance The above is nitpicking really I thought Andy carried off the overall plot very successfully Thinking of the future so far theyve done the following smaller combinations Ch23 Garnet  Delacey  Nate Ch45 Edie  Silas Ch67 Garnet  Silas  Nate Ch89 Edie  Delacey  Billy Bison So I do hope for more particularly to get to see Silas working with Delacey and to see an Edie  Garnet duo adventure And more Billy Bison if Jasper can spare any time in his busy schedule I really enjoyed the series and I think Andy was a really good plannerworld builder of a GM however I think hes weaker than both Johnny and Luke at rolling with the punches the players throw at him Andy builds well and fleshes out the world in a way that I found very satisfying hes not bad at adapting just not as strong as the others Johnny rolls with everything their biggest strength is going with the flow and letting the players shape whats happening Luke is the most rounded between world build and roleplay Just my thoughts I think Edie and Delacy are two of the strongest characters Edie in particular felt very different from Ellens other characters and it was a fun juxtaposition She really stole the spotlight when it was her time and I loved it Jasper delights me Ive never disliked anything hes been in and the one shots with him are my absolute favourites I thought the whole thing was great Entirely lived up to my very high expectations Andy has a real knack for the creepy and unsettling and for crafting mystique in stories where the darker parts of the story slowly come out as the players explore it If he ever comes back as a DM in another game one of these days I hope its for a Halloween episode Easily my favourite of the ongoing oxventure ttrpg campaigns I was so stressed throughout the whole episode Andy really did do a wonderful job Would you be able to tag spoilers pls Exceeding 3 Surpassed yesterdays high Yesterday  after over 6 of the paint motion as if it was going upI thought it was over because it was 4 closing

This guy keeps repeating the infinite cycle Jamie Dimon JP Morgan Chase CEO warns of 7 interest rates Highinterest rates  shutdowns make US stock market fall biggest since March but Wall Street experts warn we still have a long way to go and we need to prepare for a bigger shock 
JP Morgan Chase Chairman Jamie Dimon dubbed the emperor of Wall Street warned that the Fed should also prepare interest rates in the 7 range amid the Feds prolonged high interest rate and concerns over a US government shutdown Chairman Dimon warned in an interview with the Times of India TOI a leading Indian newspaper in Mumbai India that the US Federal Reserve may raise its benchmark interest rate to 7 percent adding that the world seems not ready for it yet Inflation in the US is still very high and if inflation does not continue to grip as high oil prices continue to rise the Fed can raise its benchmark interest rate to 7 and in this case stagflation will go hand in hand he warned
The US stock market has continued to decline day after day with warnings that the Feds benchmark interest rate should be prepared to rise to the 7 level
Given the remarkable resilience of the US economy the central bank will have to raise interest rates again and stay higher to cool inflation Minneapolis Fed President Neal Kashkari said amid a recent surge in concerns on Wall Street over prolonged highinterest rates as the Fed hinted at one more rate hike within this year at a meeting of the Open Market Committee FOMC The Feds benchmark interest rate should be taken higher longer As a result the 10year government bond yield market interest rate has been at its highest level since 2007 and the dollar has risen to its highest level for 10 consecutive months Due to this effect the US consumer confidence index fell sharply and the consumer confidence index in September recorded 103 This was much lower than the previous months 1087 and far below the experts estimate of 1055
Against this backdrop Moodys a global credit rating agency in the US even warned that the current US government shutdown is very likely to occur and in this case the US national credit rating could be lowered The New York Times",2
2023-10-03,"Ah man, I can't believe an Arc A380 beats an AMD RX 6900 XT. Thanks Windows Leaked footage of Userbenchmark testing department Userbenchmark would rename the AMD option to ""Neanderthal Mode"" It means an A380 at max performance beats out 6900xt in power saving mode. /s Windows was considering the performance of Airbus A380. Userbenchmark???????$AMD It does in idle power consumption, Windows is fucking right there. are you the owner of userbenchmark by any chance Why are you using both in your system? One for gaming one for probably encoding, LTT has a good video on using Arc GPUs for live streaming and recording. There's a joke about Intel power draw somewhere in this It hasnt even started yet Blue sky blue sky Red red Price justification for Vision Pro I was looking around on Sony's website and realized that Sony actually had a press release late August on 4k per eye micro OLED displays for AR/VR! This display seems incredibly similar to the one found on Vision Pro. In the PR, they released the price as well...150,000 yen, or ~$1000! So in theory, if Vision Pro is using a display of this caliber, 2x, then the displays alone would cost $2000. I'm surprised the Vision Pro doesn't cost more than it does! PR: Sony Semiconductor Solutions to Release Large-Size, High-Definition 1.3-type 4K*&sup1; OLED Microdisplay That Reproduces Realistic Spaces Enhancing the Experiential Value of VR and AR Head-Mounted Displays | Sony Corporation of America  ""According to Hsieh, the Vision Pro's displays are the most expensive hardware component, accounting for 35 percent of the device's total cost, which the analyst puts at $1,542 (including manufacturing) The second most expensive component is the two chipsets (M2, R1), which together cost about $240 and account https://mixed-news.com/en/apple-vision-pro-displays-cost/ damn. That's crazy. Suddenly that 3.5k price tag makes sense. Pretty sure we already knew this but I would think Apple gets a discount Gotta remember the meta quest pro came out at $1500 which a lot of people criticized for being too expensive. It still clearly cut many corners to get it to that price. Funny, Zuck (or was it Boz) said a year or two ago something to the effect that ?쐓ure we could put together the best headset you can imagine, but it would cost $2000 so we?셱e not gonna do that?? And now the Question Pro successor rumored for release in 2025 is reported to aim for the price of $2000. With all the technology in it, you have those two displays as well as a front display that has your eyes. You also have eye tracking and face and mouth tracking. I would say at bare minimum if they were to make any profit at all off of this venture, it would probably be at most $500. But that?셲 just a guess. Yeah, when I really sat down and thought about it, the price does make sense. The panels, the chip, the software, and even a bit of r&d tax for being an early adopter, this thing could have been a lot more expensive. Which is weird to say, but whatever I guess. Remember when people were convinced that the $3000 rumors were overestimating the price and the Vision Pro would actually cost $1500??2000? if I will only need keyboard+avp to work in the cloud im done justifying any price, better be replacing the iphone also",0

2023-10-05,Like seriously where are all the AMD cards Are you really telling me there are more gamers with a 4060ti than an 6700xt Enthusiasts always significantly overestimate how much the average person cares about their hobby For 90 of gamers a new GPU means the geforce 60  70 card of the latest generation Or just a new prebuilt which will almost always come with an nvidia card because that logo might as well mean gaming pc when its displayed on the box I feel like we are forgetting about the laptop gamers which might be more numerous than the PC gamers Most laptops Ive seen with dedicated gpus if not all are from nvidia So the stats make sense Especially laptops  I feel like the bulk of gaming laptops carry GeForce and even some nongaming laptops they strap with like a 1660 and market it to casual laptop users for the extra power Are you really telling me there are more gamers with a 4060ti than an 6700xt Yes 100 Nvidia outsells AMD by 9 to 1 roughly Nvidia holds 87

Nvidia had the bulk of the market share but what I didnt realise that Intel the new entrant to the graphics card market still on their first gen of cards risky buy as a lot of games wasnt supported at launch has a third of AMDs market share  wtf More people have a 4090 than a 6700XT lol Because Nvidias marketshare is no joke Particularly for gaming but as others have mentioned for GPU computing as well since CUDA is iften a de facto standard in many industries That said if you were to look at stats that werent from Steam but from all PCs then Intel integrated graphics would absolutely dwarf everything else Nvidia is way more populour outside of Reddit tech circles I had friends in high school who havent even heard of Radeon gpus but had RTX and GTX gpus Nvidia got the casual pc gaming market which is the biggest portion of it Us guys on reddit are small part of the overall PC market Nvidia outsells AMD by a huge margin for a few reasons They have all the mindshare among casual PC gamers ie people who dont even know that this subreddit exists They have the OEMprebuilt market on lockdown They have drivers and features that AMD just cant seem to match RTX and DLSS sell more GPUs

ramps up Fact is This is the most complicated and difficult process in the world The kinks will be iron out Yields will increase Efficiency will be found This isn as alarmist as it presents Can you explain what makes the process so difficult I know very little about this Does yield mean that even if they do everything to the best of their ability x of chips will be useless Production also ramps up when yield increases From my understanding typically fabs will have a yield target that they have to hit before it is considered commercially available It goes from RD  Risk Production  Production Each step requires a certain yield for a certain size chip TSMCs 7nm hit risk production at 70 yield from my understanding So a 50 yield might kinda be a bit of an issue for both since they are supposed to be hitting production soonish Worth it for double the transistor density It used to These days it is no longer scaling that well with performance gained with density increased Definitely in terms of pricing it no longer scales that well But why At least from initial reviews the chips dont appear too much faster or efficient roughly the same battery life vs the previous 5nm generation Lmao Korean media finding every chance to slander TSMC If it were that bad Samsung woulde gotten big orders from customers already and parading them in the news This article is a nothing burger Did I read the same article the article starts by telling readers both are having trouble says both are 60 yield and it even callouts that when samsung said they reached 60 it didnt include SRAM problem and that its not a complete 3nm process I dont see how you came to the conclusion article was bashing tsmc so badly that and I quote If it were that bad Samsung woulde gotten big orders from customers already and parading them in the news article clearly tells readers order for samsung to attract the big customers back they need to get their yield to 70 and as I said previously article says both are having problem reaching even 60 edit had to add problem in the last sentence Back in the 70 we were thrilled with 50 on some of the igfor the last century CMOS VLSI chips The stuff we made for the space shuttle was 3040 on the wafer level functional tests By industry standard I think 50 is impressively high so high that it doesnt sound real for such a advanced process In the 70s it was considered an excellent if you can get a few working devices per wafer Even in the 90s and early 2000s you see at least as many Celerons and Durons as Pentiums and Athlons so the yield must be less than half as well It sounds very unusual for a leading edge process to yield as much as 50 No its not impressively high at this point its on a low end They are past risk production now still 50 is low for that and Im sure they were expecting more More commonly new nodes at this point would be 70ish And yield loss in this case isnt Celeron its are straight up scrap Not like its entirely unexpected 3nm nodes are pushing quite a few barriers But its still low and its still going to have a hard time meeting demand which will push up prices You cant look at the chip yield as an isolated thing You need to know how large each individual chip is on the wafer and if it can accept any defects You cant just say this process yields 50 and this one 60 There is probably a better industry metric A smaller chip more per wafer should increase yield because there is less chance of a defect writing off each chip GPUs and other similar chips can accept defects in some cores They deactivate the cores and often put them into different skus depending on how many cores That seems unreasonably high for a new process node They have gotten good at making chips The last few nodes have launched at 50 and gone up to 70  80 within months 3N was also forecasted at 6070 but they are still having issues Thats not as bad as I expected running any of the EUV tooling is super hard because of the light source Not just the light source its just an unbelievably complicated process that the machine undergoes with the help of multiple modules to time it just right so that we get a wafer So 50 is fucking fantastic I would say for a process that sounds like science fiction lol Thatsnot that bad Samsung and TSMC Reportedly Struggling with 3 nm Yields One key difference is that Samsung node is a GAAFET testbed while TSMC is a mass produced end of the line FinFET Is a worse problem for TSMC at this point and I think Samsung fundamental solution is to make big fundamental changes with SF2 as SF3 is likely a test node Since the article is extensively quoting ChosunBiz though let me add two things as a Korean Chosun Ilbo touts itself as a number one newspaper in Korea but you can think of it as a bastard child between Fox News and The Sun absolute cesspool of alt right incubators that deserve zero respect And then there Korean business newspapers which exist only to pump real estate price and be a mouthpiece to big companies to the editorsgain zero understandings about industries whatsoever Imagine a crossroad between Chosun and Korean business newspaper These guys are the absolute worst of what we call the ress trashChances are the writer has no understandings that SF3 is a test node and its low yield is to be expected to some degree Likely he doesn even understand the difference between GAAFET and FinFET Whats interesting is that TSMC N2 is pretty much exclusively focused on introducing GAAFET with a very minor density improvement Wont even add BSPD until their equivalent of 18A whatever its called So if this conservative approach has any delays and the competition executes well I could see it causing TSMC to lose the lead Thats rather surprising as TSMC has been on a roll since 16nm whose risk production began almost exactly a decade ago November 2013 I guess theyre trying to push FinFET to its absolute limits with 3nm like how they pushed MOSFETs with 20nm and it turned out to be rather disastrous I mean 20nm was the main reason Snapdragon 808 and 810811 SoCs were hated so much And Nvidia and AMD just skipped 20nm altogether even though Maxwell 20 and GCN 30 Pirate Islands were supposed to be on 20nm I think only Apple A8 did reasonably well on 20nm probably because it was much smaller than SD808810 IIRC TSMC was only on a roll since N7 They were behind Samsung for both 1614 and 10nm They only introduced 16FF after cancellation of 16FF and only a couple of months before Samsung introduced their second generation 14LPP 16FF was only beating 14LPE by 1015 not 14LPP 10nm was a repeat They only introduced N10 a couple of months before Samsungs second generation 10LPP Every node iteration is a very large and expensive but calculated gamble on the approach to take To some degree theres luck involved TSMC is eventually going to hit a hiccup The same thing happened with Intel which caused them to be stuck on the same node for years My investment in INTC is looking great so far It arguable TSMC is already behind in process tech for HPC they still have a lead with mobile and hyper dense processes Looks like wee not going to be in a TSMC led monopoly for leading edge foundry services for much longer I really hope Intel does well succeeding in graphics CPUs and AI But I think the foundries are competent enough that they can keep actual yield info locked down Intel is really good for HPC but I just don think there is enough space between competitors to say TSMC will lose the lead They at least have viable competitors that may pan out I guess parity is more likely A lot of industry analysts and Intel themselves have predicted that they will have leadership in 2025 With 18A being ahead of schedule and TSMC N3B looking like a disappointment I dont think thats too far fetched as long as Intel doesnt surprise us with delays which they previously had a habit of doing However Intel doesnt even really need to beat TSMC for two reasons Samsung has made a ton of money simply being 2 in foundry services the cheaper and less capable option So IFS could rake in cash as long as they are competitive The two companies that directly compete with Intel in chip design AMD and to a lesser extent Nvidia dont use TSMCs latest nodes For CPUs AMD has had a node advantage for several years now That advantage will shrink with Meteor Lake and Intel 4 but still be a little behind If Intel only meets TSMC at the bleeding edge then thats still a node advantage for Intel over AMD and Nvidia They dont need to surpass TSMC to get a node advantage for their design team It arguable TSMC is already behind in process tech for HPC they still have a lead with mobile and hyper dense processes Nah N5N4 are flat out better than anything Intel will have till at least Intel 3 and by then N3E will have the crown Intel themselves are using N3B instead of their own Intel 3 for ARLLNL The demand is not great too They will get on top of it like they always do Advanced packaging tech works with any process It different teams working on different things 3nm is a limit everybody says that Semiconductor engineers everywhere Wat I mean thats basically what 4nm is 5nm perfected And idk whos this everybody who says 3nm is a limit the roadmaps show otherwise And the market will handle if 3nm is too expensive its not like 45nm and 67nm chips still cant be made if they are more cost effective TSMC in the US can Taiwan chip giant overcome a culture clash I dont understand their location choice in Arizona You need a huge amount of water for chip manufacturing and Arizona is having a huge water crisis and its not going to get better The water is mostly run on a closedloop circuit Its true that you need a lot of water at first But once you put the billion gallons of water into the internal system it recycles itself indefinitely You do need to every now and then add some new water or replace some old but for the most part the system runs continuously and theres not much additional water needed Cheap land few natural disasters imagine if a tornado or hurricane hit these fabs itd take years to recover Just to be clear this culture clash refers to the workplace culture Itll surely be hard for the US to adapt to this especially with the recent strike asking for a raise of 40 and work 4 daysweek Heck in companies like TSMC in Taiwan they willfully work overtime for free Thats the difference Why didnt they build around the Great Lakes Off the top of my head AZ is much closer to Silicon Valley Land is cheaper in AZ AZ state labour laws and political culture are more employerfriendly and in particular more hostile to labour unions Probably not Wafer fabrication is highly labor intensive Most people somehow think it is just a person pushing some buttons to control automation robots Part of the reason for TSMCs success is the toxic overtime culture among East Asians It seems that everyone has forgotten why the United States outsourced chip manufacturing to foreign countries This was precisely because American workers did not want to do such backbreaking work What is chip giant overcome a culture clash Does anyone really think Mr Zhang came to Arizona voluntarily to build a factory The only advantage I can think of is easy access to disposing of toxic chemicals It gonna be long long term disaster with ridiculously high cost and will be written off the balance in the decade OUE EARNED 50 CENTS    TSMC The ulture clashis from the Taiwan sidehy can they  is a better question TSMC From the Taiwan side Culture clash literally means two cultures Analysts and executives estimate that after the first two phases of the Phoenix plant reach full capacity and the company fabs in Japan and Germany are finished total sales from production outside Taiwan are unlikely to account for more than 10 per cent of TSMC revenue Good that means we can still count on US backing for a long while in case Xinnie loses his shit Just another way for the US to take what it needs for Taiwan and abandon it if China invades Glad the AZ plant isn doing so hot Taiwan needs to keep most of TSMC in Taiwan to have leverage against external parties US and China alike DPP sold out KMT legacy Reunification when What about the lack of quality or to put it more direct willing workers  according to what I have been told by some of the TSMC team from Taiwan over there thats the biggest problem Nevermind Arizona lets talk about Japan,-6

Here are mine: 18 $370 puts QQQ 1/19/24, and 15 $370 put QQZ 6/21/24 . It doesn't quite add up to $70k anymore . Here is a list of reasons the QQQ will soon be known as the river of tears ""Q_Q fucking Q"", in no particular order: Essentially back at all time highs, as if the beerflu tech bubble never popped. It didn't make sense back then when interest rates were zero and there wasn't anything else to buy, and it is pants on head regarded right now. Interest rates are back to normal levels, which after the 2007 financial crisis, means they are astronomically high and no one who survived the last fifteen years of ""buy every dip"" investing remembers what the fuck it means when fixed income is making more of a return than equities.  5% on the long end is not the top, it's just a temporary stop even if they go down for a bit . Bond yields are going to keep going up. Bond buyers will decide they aren't getting paid enough for inflation and yields will go into a death spiral until we decide to scuttle aircraft carriers and let Gam Gam starve  Tech stocks are grossly overvalued right now . QQQ current P/E is 30, their forward P/I is 26 . Expectations are for something like 15% growth this quarter, but every company is going to be guiding down and some may guide losses . My 1/19/24 puts are for this play .  The last thirty plus years of wealth has been driven in very large part by globalization . Economics 101 is that trade raises net prosperity . Deglobalization is going to drive prices through the roof and that's going to keep fueling inflation . This is my gambling account. Don't waste your life savings on yolos. Get a real job and call 1-800-GAMBLER if you are. TL;DR: Buy QQQ puts, sell some calls to pay for them, hold until the end of days. I don?셳 disagree, but that doesn?셳 mean the market is rational ?쳽 Casinos are totally rational. This is why we don?셳 need a death tax, everything inherited gets lost and returned back That?셲 a lot of words just to say you?셱e ?뙂. Good luck. sorry we had a fight during your black panther party Just go all in on TSLA puts. Why diversify? If you?셱e gambling, do it right! Insider trading restrictions means I'm currently limited to ETFs. Someone tag me when this prints....or of course dumps Just do the opposite of this guy and you could also make bank 50/50 chance This confirms it we have reached bottom!!! Thank you for your service My gambling account is still net negative mostly from puts fighting the Fed in summer 2020, so maybe. But this time it's the market fighting the Fed so I feel better. I love you and wish you the best of luck good sir. Thank you for bringing wsb closer to what it should be. Jeez I wish I had the cash to make $70k yolo that has a 90% chance of going to zero and a 10% chance of making millions Take my upvote you bastard QQQ hardly joined the selloff the last few weeks and is now entering a new bullish zone with a major green day and that's when you yolo into puts? okay. Yes.  This is a rare sound analysis for this sub lately but I think P/E might be oversimplistic . There is growth potential (though prob not a lot of mature tech) and more importantly there are just sector premiums . Tech companies have next to no overhead and many are basically monopolies . You couple that with how overweight they are in the SPY and the valuation is probably still too high but not insane. Main headwinds I'm seeing are student loans kicking back in and the general post holiday slump. And what will probably be a weak holiday season overall I miss posts like this. OP is highly regarded! Great fact based thinking, except that the market is irrational? Thank you AMD! Thanks for adding AFMF support to 6000 series cards :)  FMF is inferior to FSR3 and will be worse than high native framerate . You need high base (pre-frame-generation) FPS (60fps for 1080p, 70+ for 1440p and above) for the picture to be smoother . That being said, this is an amazing software jump for AMD, I'm using it all the time with Starfield on my 7900XT and it works great. It also turns off when you move the mouse too much, or too much action is going on. AMD have said on too fast mouse movement, but others have seen it disable itself just from a lot happening on screen. So it essentially turns on when you need it least, and disables itself when you need it most. And it deactivates during fast camera movements, which is more important than anything you said imo. I'm using it on my 7900XTX and it's really nice to have 170 FPS in New Atlantis Remember it's still a preview it will only get better with more input and feedback they receive over the next few months it will be beautiful! Not working for my part. 5600X + 6700 XT + VSync off + fullscreen. I've less fps when FMF is enable. When I disable it, it's way smoother. My experience so far as well Have exact same build as you and came here looking for answers. As the other person said, when you pull up the AMD overlay you WILL see the insanely high framerate. In my case 135fps compared to around 60fps but it dunnae matter cause those 135fps feels more like 40. I can only assume this is not quite how it's suppose to work. i tried it on 6700xt i see no fg or any frame different idk why on Hogwarts legacy and rdr2 Don't know if I'm just among the lucky few who has a setup where AFMF just works particularly well with, but.... AMD/RTG..... holy hell, ya'll finally knocked something out of the park. I am beyond impressed with AFMF. Starfield is particularly good. My humble 5800X + 6800 XT is now outputting FPS in Akila city that would make a 13900KS + 4090 nervous. 120-140 FPS, and it's smooth like buttered glass to boot and actually feels like 120+ FPS. AMD is amazing for support tbh, and im grateful to them every single time I use their stuff. Lisa su has done such an amazing job for AMD and that's why we love them all. I'm behind on all of this. Are they adding AFMF to 6000 series? Can someone link me anything? This makes my decision of buying a 6750XT instead of waiting for the 7700XT 2 months ago even better. Edit: Used my googling skills so people won't have to do it for me and found some articles, I'm impressed. AMD do be making sure I'm 100% happy I switched. Yep I do hope that the AMD mobile graphics gets this feature (6xxx and 7xxxx series). It would be nice to have the option. 84% stutter rate AFMF, no thx! Good lord! I would definitely pass on That as well! So I tested AFMF on Nolvus a Skyrim Modlist with 2000+ mods. I had a base fps of 50-70 and with AFMF I???reaching 144 maxed out! AFMF is not perfect! It does however seem to have good benefits for what I need it to do! If yes Imma be a gold master real quick I???just gonna add a thank you here too. It???long from perfect but it???a Tech Preview. I???hella grateful and definitely gonna stay with team red with my RX6700XT. Excited to see where the way goes Whats wrong with this Is it a deficit again",0

2023-10-10,"Micron Delivers High-Speed 7,200 MT/s DDR5 Memory Using 1棺 Technology Can someone explain that 1-Beta process? Smaller, less leaky transistors due to using a metal oxide instead of silicon dioxide for the gate oxide. Less leakage lets the DRAM cells be smaller and still have the same performance and hold time between refreshes, and makes all the peripheral circuits more efficient, which also allows for faster devices to be used. From what I see it is simply a process node designation. They had 1-Alpha before. 1-Beta will be followed by 1-Gamma and 1-Delta. With 1-Delta they'll possibly switch to UEV. It sounds like this means 7200 MT/s JEDEC speeds? Ampere says they'll run at 7200. Yes that is what this is. Earlier they released 6400 jedec at 1.1v and this is the next step up after that. It will run at 1.1v. Hynix A die needs 1.4v for example for similar transfer speeds. These probably come to market with Arrow Lake. Are DRAM inventories shrinking? I mostly live in the analog semiconductor world and I think the conventional knowledge is the market for analog semis will be weakening, meaning low prices. Not the same on the digital side? I just don?셳 know how much of a speed boosts I?셝 see from ddr5 at like 5000 speeds versus these 7000 or 8000 kits. I have a 13700k and 32 gb of ram so what it do? Good look finding a mobo that actually supports those speeds Relax my son Mom believes in our son right Our son will grow up to be a great person Love you son",2
2023-10-11,"AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 23.10.1 Release Notes Do my eyes deceive me? The 6000 video flickering issue moved from known issues to fixed! ""System freeze or black screen when playing video files on Radeon??RX 6000 Series Graphics Products.The display may intermittently freeze after changing the encode format while streaming select games with AMD Link."" Did they actually fix it ?????끋? edit. working fine so far. this might just have fixed the video playback issues. Anti-lag+ for CS2 is big The lag and freezing on browsers seems to be gone Well... After test for a while, can you come back and tell if it's really fixed?! For anyone who had stuttering with 23.9.2 or 23.9.3 with 6000-series cards, this set indeed seems to work without those problems. Lets see if it fixes the intermittent desktop/mouse freezing that affected 23.9.2 and 23.9.3. New Feature Highlights Fixed Issues Known Issues Important Notes Package Contents AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 23.10.1 Driver Version 23.20.17.01 for Windows吏?10 and Windows吏?11 (Windows Driver Store Version 31.0.22017.1011). noice https://imgur.com/a/qoNQiDN If anyone updated, can you guys confirm if the issue with AMD tuning returning to default state after a PC restart has been fixed? I think i'm going ot stay with the preview driver and play around with AFMF some more. Does this fix adrenalin software not opening? 23.9.2 and 23.9.3 had a weird bug where I'd try opening adrenalin only for the whole thing to disappear. Had to go back to 23.8 Also, any point in upgrading for a 5700 XT? My adrenaline is not opening with this one...was using the latest Preview driver and adrenaline was opening there, installed this and it's not opening again, 23.9.2 and 23.9.3 also didnt work for me... Not for me. Tried the October Windows 11 update, still could not open 23.9.3, and cannot open 23.10.1 after a full AMD Cleanup Utility in safe mode followed by a fresh install. Hopefully this driver fixes a possible bug with Easy Anti-Cheat and Apex Legends false flagging AMD users so we don't get banned.. That sounds like something that should be fixed by EA, doesnt it? Still no Forza Motorsport support? Did they drop support for Polaris? Neither 23.9.3 or 23.10.1 supports Polaris. No updates for Forza motorsport ? Weird... I feel like I've been updating my drivers every week for the past month lol Samsung takes on TSMC with advanced 2-nanometer fabrication push does samsung's definition of ""2-nanometer"" and tmsc ones coincide? Node names between companies haven't been comparable for a long time. The 'nanometer' name doesn't even refer to anything physical anymore, either. Samsung takes on TSMC with new advanced process? I certainly haven't heard that before a million times! Someone has a very short memory. TSMC is only leading after N7. N7 through to N4P was and still is TSMC's peak years. There's no doubt about that. N3B is a failure. We'll have to wait and see if N3E would redeem the situation. But they never did have meaningful advantage before that. 20SOC was a big blunder. 28LP was very bad before that (until 28HP arrives).  TSMC had to cancel 16FF just to get 16FF+ out (barely) in time . Apple had always intended to discontinue Samsung-made A9 . Apple chose 14LPE because it's mature and guaranteed to be available, they never considered dual-sourcing . 16FF+ is very close to 14LPP which was also used to manufacture AMD Ryzen 1000 and Zen3 IO die. N10 was again 10 months late and barely beat 10LPE just in time for 10LPP to beat it again. Kirin 970 barely beat Snapdragon 835. They were over 60% in June. Plus this is their development node. Their second gen 3nm GAA process is coming online in 2024 and that's on their foundry service roadmap. The current process is test and development. Samsung 3nm yields are similar to TSMC 3nm yields as far as we know Intel already has angstrom on their roadmap. Pico would be the most obvious next name. However, since using angstrom will have smaller marketing numbers, everyone will likely use that as a stop-gap before pico. Somehow off-topic, but what would eventually happen (regarding electronic and semiconductor production) if China decided to bomb/invade Korea and Taiwan? Would the Western countries have a backup plan? Intel would open champagne. Those are two very different events being lumped together. China will likely try to unify Taiwan before 2030, but they won't do anything with South Korea for the foreseeable future (decades). South Korea's biggest threat (ignoring their own economic issues) is North Korea, but NK would write itself out of existence if they started a war with SK. If TSMC's fabs are shut down, due to a war or saboteurs trying to cripple the Taiwanese economy (pushing them towards China for support). Then Intel and Samsung fab demand would skyrocket to levels they cannot keep up with, as TSMC does a ton of volume. Prices would skyrocket and a lot of smaller companies would not be able to produce new products. Also it is likely that the fab TSMC has in the U.S. would be taken over by the government and probably sold to Intel to keep running. The U.S. is not going to hand ownership over to China if they take over Taiwan. America passed the chips act for this very reason. We are trying to near shore supply chains. Especially after Russia showed that countries will do stupid unprofitable invasions. TSMC is opening a 5 nm fab in America although it has been going slow. Intel and others are taking advantage of the chips act to expand. This probably is no where near enough since TSMC just produces so many chips. Can?셳 get 3 working properly??. Might as well skip to 2!  Samsung 2nm is the mass production 3nm+. 3nm is a testbed and 2nm does mass production . With the capacity not as much of a problem as during the COVID days I think many more will try 2nm out and see what it?ÂÂÂ . Nomenclature aside, if Samsung reaches parity with something like TSMC 4/5nm with this node, then it?셲 a home run. TSMC is struggling with 3nm which is not a huge jump from 4/5. If Samsung is at TSMC 4/5nm level, the gap?셲 closed. And Samsung has its ways forward with GAAFET config. Then the gap gets closer or may revert. Some reports online seem to indicate that Samsung has essentially reached node parity with TSMC 4nm, albeit slightly less efficient. Samsung is rolling out a third generation 4nm node, so we'll see how that works. https://images.anandtech.com/doci/18960/samsung-foundry-roadmap.png From what I can gather, 3nm GAE is the testbed for GAA. 3nm GAP, '+' is supposed to be the mass-produced GAA. GAE wasn't actually on the roadmap, leading many to theorize that it's going to be a low volume, proof of concept node. 2nm seems to be an iteration/tweek of 3nm more, so targeting power and performance (12% performance increase, 25% power drop, 5% density improvment). https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-unveils-foundry-vision-in-the-ai-era-at-samsung-foundry-forum-2023 The iterative approach to the node is not unheard of and is pretty normal for Samsung. https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16815/4fbf6a65ly1gs77tjt248j21sj0u0n8j.jpg  China currently doesn't have domestic EUV machines (at least according to most trusteble sources) The best domestic Chinese litography scanner by SMEE which should start shipping soon is ""only"" 28nm DUV so they are at least one gen away from domestic 7nm machines . Just in time for LPP EUV prototype.",2

whenever these smaller chips come out they say it will use less power But tell me why do smartphones battery life still suck much of the time They keep pushing processing performance instead of

bombardement of disinformation which their regimes subject them to because people in China live better lives than those stuck in western societies and western regimes are thus extremely insecure and

We are past that with new 3D gate and drain technologies. My brains smooth, wrinkle free if you will. Please explain this to me. What? Now tsmc compares itself to intel? Bad title. The article actually says TSMC thinks its 2nm chips will prove superior to Intel?셲 1.8nm. It starts off with a reference to the 3nm process and apparently OP didn?셳 get any further than that and screwed up the title. Bad clickbait. Turns out I completely misread part of the opening. Given that ?쐍anometer??sizes are no longer literal descriptions of the physical chip designs, and TSMC?셲 well earned reputation, I would tend to believe them. It will be in Intel to prove they can still produce on this level. My dick is smaller than yours But is it faster? Can we have a standard of what the XXnm tech means? Is it the gate length/width or the overall size of the transistor (Source-Gate-Drain length/width)? It is not the size of anything. It's a name of their manufacturing process. You can compare it to ""baby lake"", ""skull canyon"" and ""Ada Lovelace"" or ""rtx 3090"" While the overly numeric names seem to overlap between manufacturers there is barely any correlation, except smaller is usually better and the numbers are similar-ish for similar performance. Before we dive in here to tsmc's comment, let us remember Intel is out drumming up business for its 18A foundry which is direct competition to tsmc and already is out in a testable product form based on gate all around and backside power delivery.  Intel: ""Our internal assessment shows that our N3P [?? demonstrated] demonstrated comparable [power performance area] to [Intel] 18A, my competitor's technology, but with an earlier time to market, better technology maturity, and much better cost"" ""Comparable power"" not equal, not better, just comparable power . Yeah, they are comparable nodes so it should be comparable, yet out much earlier while TSMC will be pushing to 2nm as Intel pushes 1.8nm and TSMC says that will be basically a node ahead. Saying Intel already has 1.8nm 'out' in any form is exceptionally misleading. Behind the scenes testing on nodes happens years in advance, the first wafers on a node come back anything up to 4-5 years before a node enters full scale manufacturing at a scale that actually brings chips to market. TSMC has been a node ahead of Intel for what, 5 years at this point. Your title is wrong. TSMC is talking about its 2nm process, projected for 2025, compared to Intel?셲 1.8nm process. The article does start off referencing the 3nm chips, but that?셲 not the main focus. And it also says TSMC believes their 2nm will outperform Intel. And considering TSMC is currently the leader in chip fabrication, I?셫 inclined to believe them as the default position. No idea why your comment is upvoted and the other response is downvoted. The article very plainly explains that 3nm will be comparable/onpar with Intel's 1.8nm and they believe their 2nm will simply beat Intel's 1.8nm by a margin. The title of this post very plainly says TSMC saying 3nm will be comparable to Intel's 1.8nm. the world's largest contract maker of chips believes that its N3P (3nm-class) technology will offer comparable characteristics with Intel's 18A, whereas its N2 (2nm-class) will beat it across the board in terms of power, performance, area (PPA) advantages. First paragraph in the article. Intel is a grower, not a shower. For starters, the title is incorrect and not in the article. Second, TSMC has had issues with SRAM scaling in N3 so it?셲 a big stretch to claim they have a big lead at a comparable node much less one back. The beginning of a turnaround in DRAM pricing Slowly go upStarting from the first half of next year the US interest rate will beginNasdaq Goes HighStarting from the middle and second half of next yearWe started talking about  the DRAM super cycle Tom's Hardware: ""TSMC: Our 3nm Node Comparable to Intel's 1.8nm Tech"" Of course they will say that. We need independent analysts to see if its true Will wait to see more products on 3E, Apple's A17 wasn't that impressive on 3B At this point I dont care about nodes (we shouldnt anyway), but rather the finished product's performance & efficiency. IMO it would take a massive engineering diff for a company to overcome an entire node disparity in power, though I guess raw performance is more manageable by blowing up the core (cough Golden Cove cough). Looking at what node a product might use is certainly worth ""caring"" about, I think I would be interested to have someone who works in integration or design explain which process or architecture differences will let a GAA node without BSPD outperform one with. TSMC most be confident in specific mechanisms to be this certain. Anyone have any insight on this? TSMC's 3nm isn't even GAA, unless I'm misinterpreting you it might be Samsung's 3GAE/P that you're thinking of Interesting.. I heard rumors that Intel 4 was slightly better than TSMC 5nm I thought it's the reverse: ""Intel: our 10nm node comparable to TSMC's 7nm tech"". That was before Intel rebranded their roadmap. Under their old naming scheme, 18A would be ""5nm+"". They essentially rebranded themselves from a node ahead at a given name, to a node behind. Well yeah. Intel's new nodes don't immediately scale up and compare to TSMC new nodes. Just look at how Intel's 10nm Cannon Lake process was a downgrade from 14nm++ and it was first launched in 2018, but took them until 2021 Alder Lake to actually be an improvement from 14nm++. With TSMC, N7 was launched in 2018 and N6 was launched in 2020 with each node being an improvement over the one before it. In all fairness, Cannon Lake was a CPU launched on a premature node, before it should have, just as a compliance chip to technically meet promises made to investors. It's not indicative of the final product. For all intents and purposes, Intel 7 is very much a TSMC N7P competitor. Intel 4 has a more drastic node density improvement vs Intel 7, when comparing TSMC N7 and N5. Granted, all we've seen of N3 is N3B in the A17 Pro, and it's extremely underwhelming. Don't know how much improvement N3E will bring, but if it's not that much different than N3B, than saying N3 is superior to 18A feels like an overly confident statement. By what metric is this based? Density? Perf/watt? It's not based on design, as N3 is still on FINFET and lacks BSPD Or put more succinctly, Intel has had more trouble scaling performance and power with new nodes vs TSMC. TSMC is probably right to claim they will lead with N3P vs 18A. I remember back in the day when intel was struggling terribly to bring 130nm up... iirc ibm and AMD brought SOI to mass production around that time and was just having a comparative field day for what felt like a couple of years before i tels shit finally got fully in gear in I want to say the 65nm node... all I remember for certain is that intel 90nm was a fucking dumpster fire Point being intel will get it sorted and I have no doubt intel will return to leadership if not dominance in a lil' while. Doom sayers say doom. Surprise surprise. Did anyone expect TSMC representatives to say ""Intel's beaten us in nodes this time. ARGH"" slamming their fists? This looks like just a long way of saying that TSMC is now behind in terms of nodes, but the stakeholders should not short because TSMC's overall PPA is allegedly better. Yeah, when has a company ever come forward and said their competitor is a threat? On very rare occasions it happens, but 99% of the time it's just dismissals and attacks. When a company is far ahead of the competition, they don't even bring up the competition. TSMC has been putting out negative comments about Intel nodes/IFS ever since Pat made it his mission to refocus on Intels foundry and make IFS happen. TSMC seems far more fearful of Intel than they do of Samsung or SMIC. Every couple of weeks there is a new statement by someone affiliated with TSMC trying to dismiss Intel as competition, Intel is either a weird obsession or a threat to them. Huh-uh. We will look at the real world results They should stop talking ""nm's"". Give us useful metric's like, transistor density, yield and energy efficiency. The fact they are even making that comparison means that TSMC has lost its lead. TSMC used to be years ahead of Intel, to a point where TSMC wouldn't even compare themselves to Intel or Samsung, and now they are trying to justify how they are still competitive against Intel. Plus what they claim isn't even accurate, according to TSMC's latest roadmap N3P is a 2025 product, and on Intels side 18A is ahead of schedule and pushed forward to H2 2024, according to their latest roadmap and discussions.",2

Yes, and the article spends half it's length basically trying to contradict ASML's statement on it. Which is odd to say the least... You don't have to be a national of that country to do industrial espionage... The most effective espionage assets are not foreign nationals. Western companies cant do that because they will be sued for discrimination, though hypocritically they wouldn't be allowed into high security government work due to their background. It's quite the opposite in China where while they do have anti-discrimination laws, they are only enforced when they align with what the CCP believes. Unfortunately I have a bad feeling of what this thread will devolve into, and its not a civil conversation. A lot of Western countries already don't issue visas to Russian nationals because any one of them can be a deep-cover FSB agent for all they know. Would've thought the enlightened world wouldn't go as far as to discriminate against entire nationalities based on the actions of their (widely known to be undemocratically elected) government, but here we are. If that's the case on the state level, then private companies refusing to hire Chinese nationals for positions with access to trade secrets honestly doesn't sound that far-fetched. They'd lose a a substantial fraction of their workforce. That's not a tradeoff any major tech company would willingly make. And this would hardly be the only example in tech. Look at how Samsung got FinFETs working, or some details from the Apple Qualcomm suit. No sense cutting off your nose to spite your face. China has been undertaken substantial corporate espionage for the last three decades against western companies. None of these were during periods when the United States embarked on any major export controls against China. https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/archives/survey-chinese-espionage-united-states-2000 https://search.justice.gov/search?affiliate=justice&sort_by=&query=Chinese+espionage+&commit=Search  Both USA and China have exploited the security exception within the WTO GATT in order to undertake negative trade measures against the other .

I like the Minecraft one more, not sure I get the need for blood and a real knife. Yeah seeing as though it is mainly a gaming channel too. If YouTube isn't there to demonetize you, why not go crazy with the thumbnail? /s After actually being stabbed with a knife this year I definetly prefer the Minecraft version ???there is no need for a tech channel to try trigger my ptsd. I actually actively disliking the floatplane one. Not because it's more graphic or anything, but more like, It's on floatplane where people paid for to access it. I think clickbait title and thumbnail is really unnecessary. Like you don't need to attract them anymore. They already paid you. Having different clickbait thumbnail than YT makes it worse because they actively choose a different thumbnail, and yet it's still clickbait. With that said, realistically they don't do it with that intent in mind. Most likely they've made the real knife one first. Then realize, ""oh wait, we can't use it on YT"" then maybe someone in the process decide, ""well it's a shame that we've made this version, let's just use it on floatplane."" Yeah, they should've just put photos of cardboard boxes in the thumbnail. slash s The similar thumbnail has the effect of immediately recognizing the same video that is on yt They are both cringy as fuck to be honest Youtube does not like the knive to much, i bet. YouTube. The Minecraft sword is some dumb fun. It's recognisable and it catches your eye. The knife is way too serious and no need for blood. We get the idea. They??켩 both bad? I still don't get where the ""betrayed"" part is after watching the whole video...is this a reference to the Secret Lab's attempt to lure Adam to use their deskpad instead of LTT's? Up until this video, I never consider any LMG video as clickbait (vague or emotional != clickbait imo). But even the title isn't related to the video itself much, it's still a great video, I just forgot what the title of the video even was until I checked the watch history in order to watch some part of it again. the secretlabs pad is them shoehorning one of their stories into the video. I dont remember where but they mentioned that every video needs to have an overarching story from intro to outro. The betrayal and redemption kinda fits that but is also kinda lame as it was solved within the first 60 seconds  The whole video was supposed to be based on the joke that he didn???buy an LMG mousepad, but Linus found out right in the beginning (not scripted) that he actually did buy the mousepad . This was a sloppy video, which honestly is fine. It???just a tech upgrade video, so nothing serious . Again not that serious, who cares. Just sloppy in a funny way. The YouTube one. The edit on that blood does not look good I actually liked the thumbnails, and think the second has a fun Halloween aesthetic. They're both awful clickbaity garbage. I think it's more about what isn't going to get them demonitized on YouTube. I like the one with the Minecraft Sword more. The real knife is too real. I hate them both.

2023-10-24,"Ha it might break 100 floors by tomorrow lol Seems like a tough week Will I be the only one looking at the stock price tomorrow Front digit is 9 TXN - good entry point? It's down about 13% since this August and about 23% down since the high it reached in 2021. It seems like a mainstay company though and grew both revenues and earnings in 2022. With the PE at 17.6 currently, is this not a pretty good entry point? I think it is a solid company with good management. Also good dividend track record. Business model wise they are fine as well. More and more household goods use chips. I have been buying slowly. Scaling in on TXN. More news to come for semi related items to China. Which causes dips even if they don't sell the latest nodes. More interest rate hikes seen as bad for all semi/tech/growth companies. Geopolitical risk is growing daily now. Two wars/conflicts. US political risk. We have no Speaker still. 2024 election coming up, will be a shitshow. Debt ceiling/budget fight again. None of the last paragraph is relevant as hindsight shows. As for China, that?셲 one of the reasons to invest in TXN. They?셱e one of the only companies outside Intel that?셲 reshoring. All that CapEx is going to lead to explosive growth and companies will crawl to them to limit exogenous risk. I?셝 argue TXN is a candidate for being a cornerstone of any portfolio with a long term horizon - meaning buy on fear, cash in on overexcitement I sold mine recently. They're coming into a big capex cycle for a few years which will hurt profits. Also, I think falling demand for autos will hurt their business for awhile. That's been the big thing holding up their earnings lately. That said, long term it's an absolutely amazing company. I'll keep it on my watchlist. They're coming into a big capex cycle for a few years which will hurt profits. Technically no. Capex is on the cash flow statement and shouldn't affect net income. Yea, please buy and come bag hold with me :)  TXN rn has barely any cash flow rn due to heavy CapEx spending during a down cycle period . TXN isn't a struggling company before and are not trying to transform the business . They have extremely high ROIC as well as margins which shows their moat . I've had my eye here too. More declines seem likely, perhaps back to the pre-covid price. But I'd say starting a position here if one likes the company makes sense.",0
2023-10-25,"Qualcomm will use both Samsung Foundry and TSMC to fabricate Snapdragon chips Here we go again... Alright lottery is it. There's nothing to suggest they're going to dual source any particular SoC. They're just saying that they don't use TSMC for every product line. Should be said not for the 8gen3. I suspect if Samsung gets their act together then Qualcomm will. TSMCs 3nm node doesn't look too great anyway. Bit of a misleading headline/clickbait. Samsung's 3nm is ahead of the TSMC N3 schedule and it's likely they'll at the very least catch up to TSMC. GAAFETs will hopefully produce tangible power savings. Misleading headline. The actual bits of the article that matter: ""Qualcomm Senior Vice President Alex Katuzian, speaking to South Korean media at the Snapdragon Summit 2023 event, said that Qualcomm can identify in advance which foundry (semiconductor chip fabrication firm) has the best process technology for the latest processor.""  Samsung Foundry and TSMC are the only foundries in the world that can make chips using 5nm or better process technologies . While TSMC is superior up to 4nm process, industry experts say that Samsung foundry might have an edge when it comes to 3nm or newer process technologies due to its GAA (Gate All Around) transistor Qualcomm will use Samsung's Foundry if Samsung's Foundry gets its shit together, and if GAA is good for 3nm and smaller. It's snapover What happened to Samsung 3nm GAA? It was supposed to be ready now. ITT: people not reading the article, classic reddit Guys, this isn't saying they'll use them for the same CPU. They'll probably have the low end on Samsung, high end on TSMC. Just like they do today. ""Samsung foundry sux"" - chillz, what are you going to do now? Samsung foundry sucks at the moment but it does not mean it will suck forever. It still sucks, it's a fact Samsung foundry does suck, but this isn't necessarily a problem. They're probably not stupid enough to dual-source a flagship chip with Samsung terrible 4 nm node. They're doing this for Samsungs upcoming nodes and will probably keep it to lower-end products if it ends up sucking. Subreddit in shambles I don't think this is that surprising, Apple purchased a huge amount of TSMC capacity recently. I ended up switching my main phone to iphone and probably won't switch back until qualcomm makes better chips. Still keep a motorola for the occasional android usage though Corners are being cut everywhere to keep funding the yachts Welp. Time to switch to Mediatek's Dimensity chips.

When I saw Fridays weekI dont have high expectationsIt expects a loss of 67 cents per shareThats a huge deficit Is it any wonder why? https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-insiders-sell-us-140014179.html With today's victory, there are now three jury trials that Micron will face for infringement of Netlist patents, ranging from DDR4, DDR5, HBM, LRDIMM and NVDIMM. Remember Micron does not have and has never had a license and all of these trials will take place over the next few months in 2024, the first of which is January 22nd. Micron will settle sooner, make your own DD. I told you in previous posts to be on the lookout for Monday. Well, Netlist obtained a huge victory that makes the 0136 case huge in sales volume of accused products and very significant dollar amounts as Hong said. Three of the four patents have been validated by the PTAB. I think we need to stop tying every negative event to NLST. Other factors could also explain this. Such as Micron, a $66 stock is up overall $15 YTD. With speculation that the fed is going to start reversing interest rates, China pulling back on rare earth metals and other negative market speculation. I would sell and not buy company stock too. This is very interesting.... This testimony can be used and presented in all pending jury cases. The testimony of Paul Meyer, Samsung's executive and expert in the jury trial regarding damages and highlights of Jason's cross-examination . . Fireworks One point is that Paul Meyer is interesting because he has abandoned the ridiculous 8 million figure for the most part and tried to focus on the equivalency to the SK Hynix deal. (Note that Sk Hynix is killing Samsung on HBM because they couldn't compete until they stole Netlist products.) During Jason's cross-examination, Jason discussed the value of Netlist's patents. Jason presented evidence that Samsung executives admitted : ""THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO NETLIST PATENTS!"" They have no solution! Jason told Mr. Meyer how valuable the patents are and asked if they had an alternative and Paul Meyer confirmed : ""THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO NETLIST PATENTS""!!!!! That's why they are worth 303M!"" Jason repeated, ""These are very valuable patents!!!"". Make your own DD. Great victory today.. the case will resume where it was adjourned, with the claims construction hearing. Remember what Hong said: large volume of product defendants with significant dollar amounts in liability. In April 2022, Netlist filed a complaint for patent infringement against Micron Technology in the Western District of Texas. On May 11, 2022, Judge Yeakel entered a stay of the case pending the resolution of Micron?셲 requested Inter Partes Reviews. The results of the Inter Partes Reviews: Patent 314: All claims patentable Patent 035: Some claims patentable Patent 608: All claims patentable (IPR denied) Patent 833: No claims patentable Sorry not following. Can you explain? The outcome of the lawsuits Netlist vs Micrumb doesn?셳 look favorable to Micrumb??so their executives are selling their shares it appears. The amount they would owe is probably negligible in their grand scheme of things. A mere drop from their bucket. So, not likely to cause executives to sell. But, something else could be happening. You need to look at Micron?셲 liability statement in the last earnings report. Trying to remember wasn't there a mention of liability and NLST psecific in a reported form?with Micron?

2023-11-01,"No shareholders here Interesting Quiet in the room It feels like the shareholders are absent Would you pay $100 more for a TSMC made chip and Qualcomm 5G modem? Current Pixels use Tensor chips made by Samsung Foundry and co-designed by Google and Samsung LSI. The 5G modems are also supplied by Samsung. Of course as well documented these parts are far from being the best and have caused issues for many users. With the rumour that the Pixel 10 in 2025 will use a TSMC made chip fully designed in-house by Google, ditching Samsung for both the SoC design and manufacturing. This then raises the question of what modem will Google opt to use? There are only a few companies in the world that can make advanced 5G modems: Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek and Huawei. Qualcomm is without doubt the market leader when it comes to having the best 5G modem technology. But their products come with a steep price. Using Samsung fabricated SoC and Samsung modems are the main reasons why Google has been able to price the Pixel 6-8 aggressively and undercut the competition. If we assume they move to TSMC and use Qualcomm's modems for the Pixel 10, will you hypothetically be willing to pay $100 more?  At the current price, Tensor should have a more equal footing with its competitions already . I understand that Pixels and Tensor are more about software, AI and machine learning . People need to stop excusing and defending Google for Tensor . That's the easiest yes ever. If you replaced the G3 with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 that was downclocked to match the G3 then it would use a lot less power. Probably less than half once the clocks ramp up, which would dramatically cut battery drain in heavy usage scenarios. The overall boost to battery life from more efficient components (RAM and Storage too) would be considerable, maybe 25% or more. Not to mention the considerably better GPU and modem. They should had a tsmc chip for 8 series for that price tag. I bought it anyway but it's overpriced. I'd pay 100 more for a phone which much better battery life. I don't care who makes the innards. TSMC fabrication and Qualcomm modem will provide that. I did... And went to Motorola with a Snapdragon... Worth every penny... It's not a Pixel, but it just works. I'd pay $200 more for a TSMC made chip, Qualcomm 5G modem, and a Qualcomm ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. Those are my only hardware qualms with current gen Pixels and those changes would make it perfect imo Personally? I have a fine experience with the current Pixel and their Samsung made parts. I'd have to say no myself. Nice survey Google As long as it doesn't overheat, I'm cool with either. The thermals were such a letdown The 5G modem yes, the chip itself wouldn't make a night and day difference. I've found that in terms of battery usage per system, that my 5G mobile connection actually consumes about 45-52% of my overall battery usage. Only then followed by the CPU with about 22%, Screen about 12% etc. Yes I understand that the Snapdragon Gen 3 has much better results in the benchmarks than the Tensor G3, but I doubt it would make a significant difference in my day to day use of my Pixel 8 Pro. It is more of a nice to have then a need to have for me. It is my understanding that Qualcomm will not sell you a modem without one of their processors (excluding Apple). So that leaves Mediatek. Not sure if they will sell just the modems. I'm sure this post is inspired by the dozens of poorly written articles that have been flooding the internet on this issue. I don't have any issues with any of the phones. All the stupid clickbait articles on chips are usually done under false premises or not in actual consumer environments and how the majority of people actually use their device.  Qualcomm chip is designed to run Google's own algorithms . It runs the Google Assistant almost instantly and far better than something like the Pixel 3 ran it at . As far as raw processing power; I don't know many people who buy phones to game at all; so the Google Tensor chip being less powerful for gaming is irrelevant to the overwhelming majority of users. As far as raw processing power; I don't know many people who buy phones to game at all; so the Google Tensor chip being less powerful for gaming is irrelevant to the overwhelming majority of users. It's not just about performance. It's also about efficiency. https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/17747nx/golden_reviewer_tensor_g3_cpu/ The idea that a Qualcomm chip will run superior AI to Google is pretty ridiculous when Google is designing a chip to run their own algorithms. You are underestimating Qualcomm's hardware prowess. Qualcomm's chips can run AI models such as Llama and Stable Diffusion on device. https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23928867/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-on-device-ai-meta-llama-2 Can Tensor do that?  My old iphone 12 mini utterly obliterates my pixel 7 pro in terms of performance and heat, which is shocking because that phone could still get warm at times . With the snapdragon 8 gen 1+ and 8 gen 2, no one who buys any flagship android phone except for pixels has to think about it . Its more like the double of that. At least. A gen2 Snapdragon is approx 150 USD, for pure cost. A g3 tensor imo 50 USD. Consumer price is easily double if not 3 times. So the question is better asked at 250 USD diff. Or a free watch 2. Yes. I would pay that diff. Lol. But seriously I buy it for the other qualities anyway. My p8p battery last two days easily.  Only thing I've had issues with on my 6 is the modem for 5g . I just set the phone to LTE preferred and have had 0 issues since . Not like I need the speeds 99% of the time from 5g so I just leave it off unless I'm doing something that the extra bandwidth helps . Yes Yes today Whats going on",0

Sooooo close and yet so far all i want is for windowsadrenalin to stop resetting my tuning settings every time i turn my pc on edit issue persists for me on Windows 11 23H2 update Any news on when theyll update the AFMF driver to be on par with the lasted stable release somewhere Q1 2024 most likely as they said when AFMF beta landed List as both a fixed and known issue Performance Metrics Overlay may report NA for FPS on various games That issue has been really pervasive and annoying so hopefully its actually fixed The control panel will still not open up for me it is broken since 23102 2391 unfortunately  PS I hoped for some talos principle 2 improvements 6800XT Windows 10 Alan Wake 2 runs rock solid 60 FPS and image look much better less grain where on previous drivers it was stuttering and frame rate was unstable Is AMD build that bad Hi I am builiding my first pc and I wanted to go for AMD buildcpugpu because from what I understood they have better value for money so I showed some IT guy I know who has 30 years expirience the spec I was offered and he told me I was making a mistake and If you want a computer where you will play and not be its technician only intel nvidia Samsung EVO disk  I oppose this platform it is not the same as Intel in terms of performance reliability heating and quality and the whole issue of drivers is problematic relative to Intel most of the people I asked has told ne to go for AMD build but I trust his perspective did he overreacted or he has a point Edit thanks everyone you gave me the confidence boost to go for it Dudes old and cant change his opinions The 7800x3d and 7950x3d is the best gaming cpu currently available In terms of heating yeah Intel draws 350w with their top end cpu compared to 150w of AMD so if you want your pc to be a spaceheater intel is a better choice most people dont want that though rnewmaxx has a flowchart in the stickied post for ssds For gpu yes AMD doesnt have a 4090 competitor but theyve got options for everything else You can look at gamers nexus or hardware unboxed for good reviewers I run into these old computer techs as well They often become rriedto a brand and recommend only that brand Im old and I know that that old guy is stuck in his ways and full of crap Honestly though I know younger people that wont change their opinion too although for a different reason fanboys But yeah old people stuck in their ways is worse The lesson here is that there are lots of ignorant people more than there should be Yeah big overreaction If it was 10 years ago that would be a fine sentiment Like the Samsung SSD recommendation they still make good ssds but theres a dozen other companies that do it just as well or better Just look at reviews from unbiased outlets Some even have long term updates on AMD platforms theyve used for 3 years Hardware Unboxed on YouTube is excellent as is gamers nexus Sounds like he has stake in UserBenchmarkcom See bot response below Especially the Samsung EVO remark because my 840 EVO had firmware so bad that even after the fixes roughly 23 of its used PE cycles are because of the fixed firmware UserBenchmark is the subject of concerns over the accuracy and integrity of their benchmark and review process Their findings do not typically match those of known reputable and trustworthy sources As always please ensure you verify the

questions or concerns Yea ignore him The last Nvidia card I had was a Geforce3 and Ive been AMD ever since with no problems at all My current 6900XT  5800X3D is absolutely solid Its the heating that got to me Intel is definitely less efficient and runs much hotter forcing you to get better cooling options Even their GPUs are really good At least for now Im going AMD Been using and assembling computers for 30 years That IT guy is one of the ones I nod at and just agree with even though hes wrong Its just easier to let him think hes correct I would like to point outIT does not mean hardware specialist nor software IT has very specific knowledge base and use of that knowledge for their specific needs so yes your IT friend does not know much of what he is taking about many years in IT and now generally a data analyst but long term pc hardware hobbyist AMD and intel are fighting neck and neck right now on CPUs AMD has the better cost to performance especially with their 7800x3d since itcomparable and sometimes faster than a 13900k for gaming Intel really needs to drop their pricing to compare better against AMD Frankly we are in a very good period of time on competition for many of the pc parts Note AMD did have a period of time when their software plainly sucked The problems during that time is no longer valid now but people still point to it as if AMD is the only one who had software issues perseverance wins Now Im contemplating Should I go out sold yesterday As expected giving chances to disappear today LOL,4

All those individual names you mentioned are basically the largest components of the large cap weighted indexes, so you?셱e basically going balls to the wall on VOO2. I would argue the less sexy but more responsible thing to do would be to diversity away down cap weightings toward other factor tilts. The top is in I think INTC has the most speculative growth out of all the ones he has listed, but it is also the most risky. I think it's fine depending on his risk tolerance. I really like the direction INTC is headed. I expect you are just chasing for the big stocks in tech sector and use your metric ""went up over 1 year "" to predict future returns. There are a lot of flaws with that thinking. Tech stocks went up 20% because they lost that much the year before. Look at AMZN or Google over 5 years. If you do fundamental analysis, their chance of future growth isn't that big. They trade often at high valuations, just because they are big. If you think their business model is a chance for growth and the price is justified, buy. But don't buy because they are big, tech and just made up 30% they lost before. With VOO, you already have large exposure to those hig companies. If you don't have deeper insights or understanding, I would advise you to go full VOO, Everyone being so against INTC makes me pretty happy with my long shares. Already up like 40%, I did most of my buying in the 20s",6

They gotta make it work nicely with vsync on,/frame caps/VRR .. not nice to have it spewing more fps than what my monitor can handle thus wasting more power... I have been trying to install gentoo for the last 5 days and i suck at it  I have been trying to install gentoo for the last 5 days and each time i get a different error . I have a Intel Celeron G3930 (2) @ 2.900GHz and a NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 graphics card . the output of lspci below in case its needed:  Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v6/7th Gen Core Processor Host Bridge/DRAM Registers (rev 06) boot wasn't mounting (unknow filesystem type: vfat) You need vfat support in your kernel :P You might like to consider gentoo-kernel-bin if you're inexperienced at doing your own kernel config, and you can chroot in from popos to load your kernel with vfat into /boot vfat came by default if i am not mistaken and i double checked to see if it was enabled. I will consider reinstaling gentoo with the bin kernel if nothing works, or can you just switch to it? can i recover this install? Sure, just boot from something else (a live iso) and chroot back into it also what things should i add or remove on my kernel?  When you system is up and running you can start making your own compiled kernel . I'd recommend compiling gentoo-kernel and then taking the saved .config from it and strip it down rather than trying to build one from the ground up . Do not use your own kernel. i fixed the problem and now i have a fully working gentoo thanks to a wonderful guy at the gentoo forums the problem was that i had a very messy grub and uefi and grub was not loading my kernel. I also had a bad resolv.conf. what i did was copied the reslv.conf from the livecd mounted sda1 to /efi instead of /boot rm -rf * inside /boot efibootmgr -b -B on leftover entries then installed the binary distro kernel i then reinstalled grub and did its stuff and now its working :) also how to change the title to [solved]? i have a Intel Celeron G3930 I've owned one of these years ago and gcc would incorrectly detect the cpu and enforce incompatible cflags when -march=native was used. This was perhaps sometime in 2017 and I don't recall which gcc compiler version was current at the time. I dont know of this still occurs but you could test which resulting cflags resolve-march-native prints because -march=skylake was the result that produced incompatible compile optimizations with this cpu. this resulted in binaries that had been compiled with unrecognizable cpu instructions that could not be executed. Some cpu's require using only -O2 -pipe or similar cpu generic cflags or binaries will be incompatible. If this is not the concern using a custom kernel build likely would be one reason you've faced such unreasonable and unnecessary challenges installing gentoo as a novice. Custom linux kernel builds are no longer necessary to install gentoo and at least having gentoo-kernel-bin to use as the functional reference kernel would resolve many potential complications.  If you build a kernel config using no kernel modules userland hardware device device firmware loading will not function and your wifi, bluetooth, ethernet, graphics card and more will fail to function properly . Using the provided kernel config from the -bin distro kernel to attempt to learn custom kernel config is a very wise option . That mentioned the G3930 I owned performed very well at the time overall considering it's a celeron. 6th gen intel celeron with an nvme ssd was surprising once the kinks were ironed out. i am using march native, what should i use instead? Use the dist-kernel (or the bin-kernel). I've compiled my own custom kernel lots of times and still went with dist-kernel because the difference is negligible and just choosing dist-kernel is quicker and hassle-free. Same. Just using dist-kernel with custom config snippets is the way General piece of advice: don't wipe your system and start over because there's an error. Just fix the error instead. If you can't figure out how to fix a given error using the interwebs, ask ""How to solve X error"". That's still bound to be far simpler and faster than reinstalling an entire system.",0
2023-11-10,"$NVDA $AMD rise - Chip gains as sector ending week strong Semiconductor stocks soar to end the week, with interest rate stabilization fueling a tech rebound. $AMD up nearly 5% with high trading volume, $NVDA gains 3% on robust chip sales to a Chinese AI startup. $INTC rises 3%, while $AVGO grows 4% amid political concerns over its VMware deal. On Friday, the White House said that President Biden will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on November 15 as the two countries look to continue to improve relations. Additionally, there was a fresh report that Japan plans to provide subsidies to the global chip foundry to expand in the country. Also seeing strong gains on Friday were analog provides, including Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), along with smartphone linked names, including Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO) and Micron Technology (MU). How is Nvidia selling to Chinese startups? The surge today was due to TSM's monthly revenue data, exciting people of the growth rebound after many months of negative MoM sales. I have tsm at 99 I've been waiting to sell forever, but with the positive news, im debating holding, and it's #1. But its also an adr Selling because it went down. Should've averaged down. Can the USA afford to lose Taiwan? (TSMC) TSMC is responsible for about 2/3rds of global semiconductor production, with possibility of sanctioning or tariffs it would allow Xi to exert a lot of pressure on the United States is this a reasonable assumption ? TSMC is special. It?셲 not just technology. There is a unique culture built around the innovation of chip design. If invaded or bombed or otherwise disturbed it will not survive and it can not be rebuilt elsewhere. What has grown and developed on the island of Taiwan is an international treasure, we all benefit from it and should respect it.  The question is what will happen if TSMC falls into the hands of the CCP? Will the current employees continue to stay and work for the party? Will they flee to the US or elsewhere? Will China attempt to prevent them from doing so? Will Taiwan's army simply let the CCP take over? Will US allow it? Some have suggested that Taiwan or the US would destroy TSMC to prevent it from falling into CCP hands.  USA is restricting TSMC (and other advanced chip technology companies) from supplying China. That all makes very good sense from the perspective of arresting your rival?셲 technology development. However, there was not a single indication of China wanting to take Taiwan for its chip factory .  A Taiwan invasion will severely limit US chip supply and expose its dependence on tsmc . The important thing is that US need to build up its own fab to wean itself off on foreign chip manufacturing . China also desperately wants to break the 1st island chain, and wants free access to the Pacific. Oh yeah totally, that's why this isn't just some random island in asia..its a cornerstone of modern industry and technology. Without that production, the entire modern world is in a bad spot. US is trying to boost its own production, but honestly China would have the world by the balls for a decade or so if they managed to control Tiawan. Even if china was able to take taiwan, those TSMC factories will be destroyed by american missiles. And the machines to rebuild the factories can only be found in the west. Even with TSMC out of the equation, Taiwan is of vital importance to American national security, which is why we?셶e always been willing to defend it with military force, even before semiconductors were invented I don?셳 think so. TSMC and chip scene is unique talent bed that?셲 hard to replicate elsewhere. Similar how every country and even states within US tries to replicate ?쁲ilicon valley?? while there?셲 a lot of achievement, none to the same level of success as Bay Area/SV. Taiwan is the biggest promoter of democracy in Asia region. So ideology, they?셱e really important. Military strategy wise. It?셲 also too important to simply let it go. I thought India was biggest promoter of democracy  TSMC manufactures chips based on American inventions . 100 % of the novelty going on 2nm were first developed as concepts in US universities . Design of the nodes hand held by Apple, and and Nvidia .  If they invent the transistor that comes after nanowire, it will be similar to foxconn coming up with the next consumer product after phone . tsmc culture , so mysticized here, since they are the market leaders is also not capable of inventing to stay the leader . as always we over attribute the market leader with mystical properties . tsmc isn't exactly the bedrock of innovation , they are simply a product of apple and Intel, Apple winning and Intel losing. I hope US gets its act together like it did for smartphones. The presence of TSMC is one of the very reasons Taiwan is somewhat safe. This is referred to as Taiwan?셲 ?쐓ilicon shield,??and this subject has appeared in articles as nauseum. There is an article from the New York Times about Taiwans silicon shield written in 2000ish that sounds like it could have been penned today. You should check it out. US cannot. And not solely for chip reasons.  Even were we to write off TSMC, Taiwan serves as a point-of-constraint for PLAN power projection into the Eastern Pacific . It's a critical national security issue for the US from several angles . China is cognizant of how reliant we are on a democratic Taiwan to maintaining freedom of navigation, trade, and security in the Far more than Ukraine and the Middle East, a conflict over Taiwan will define the rest of the century. If it were ever at the risk of falling to the CCP in the event of an invasion, they wouldn?셳 hesitate to self sabotage. Counterintuitively , PRC wouldn?셳 dare launch an all amphibious assault on Taiwan since they need the tech as much as the US needs it Flowing down Lets hit it off If Samsung Electronics could go up a bit too OOOs arch is so heavy that it doesnt go up",2

Hoping I get a pristine here soon ?솋?뤍 Did you get back blue and black 9.5s in the same order? No haha but wouldn?셳 that be something?ㄳ??. Those are just some I?셶e traded for and are in my PC currently. aww man you should have sent in those 9.5s to be re-slabbed as 10s. I would call them and check to see if they are still doing it. Awesome collection though, that SWSH Japenese pikachu is beautiful! I emailed them maybe a few weeks ago once I got a couple of them! They said that they would be doing the relabeling indefinitely but the price may change! CGC FTW Do you guys prefer CGC over PSA? I'm going to send in my first grading but I wanna make sure I choose the right company to go with. Props for not going with stupid psa! Appreciate it man! Honestly will only use PSA for easy 10?셲 or cards I just want to resell tbh or trade. I?셫 all in for the Pristine 10?셲 they are beautiful! Congratulations on the sub return. Excellent choice going CGC, love their new look. Thank you man! As do I. PSA is just extremely bland to me and I?셫 not a sheep! I love the look of CGC and it?셲 growing more on me everyday That Pikachu is one of the cards I want most in life The stamp box is such a good card! I think the market on that card will double soon! Lol you got the cheap non gold tens It?셲 called a Pristine and I?셫 not sure if you see the cards or not but calling anything about this post cheap is absurd lol?Ⅲ I appreciate the thought though. Just glad they aren?셳 ugly PSA slabs! Thanks to you I want to try flexing on Christmas",8

2023-11-21,"28 M , how is academia for 3 yrs experience in semiconductors Hi folks, I have myquals: BTech in India and masters (semiconductors) in USA. I have 3 years of corporate experience in VLSI domain. Due to some personal reasons, I may have to move back to India. Also, due to personal reasons, I prefer job in academia. May I please know how is the job opportunity in academia in India ? Are there any exams needed to be a professor or lecturer ? What would be the salary range ? I understand I do not have a PhD but still a job in academia can immensely help. Thanks for the help!  Due to my health condition, my doctor told me to better have a job which has routine or order to it . Being in semiconductor industry is more fluctuating which affects my health . I feel teaching can be a good job to take and I do not have to worry on money now . Please add some paragraph breaks to your submission by placing a blank line between distinct sections. Users are more likely to read and comment on your post if it's more readable! I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns. There are alot of design houses of you are looking for a job in design. PhD is mandatory now for teaching in colleges. No one has dedicated Semiconductor courses. IIT Mumbai has a GaN lab under electrical, IIT madras does some work on design side. Rest are all govt enterprises. You need to be more specific in terms of what you want.  I used to teach my friends before exams and I loved it. Leave the bigger colleges as they require PhD, is it possible to enter Tier 1 or Tier 2 colleges as lecturer or professor? I can say that it is not helpful in the long run in terms of health . Don't go to academia without PhD... Being a lecturer doesn't pay shit compared to what you can earn in industry.. Apply to companies like Intel, Google, Nvidia, Texas Instruments, Juniper Networks Hi, sorry could have been more elaborate. My doc, due to my health condition told me to have a job which has structure. So, for now I can compromise money for health. Thanks! Build ideas for 3.23 Breach and Legion farmer Hi! So I'm starting to be done with the Tota league. So it is time to start thinking about what to do in the next league. This league I did bossing, boss rushing and Harbinger farming with Necro Poison SRS. Next league I would like to do some Legion and Breach farming. Here is the plans for the Atlas tree.  If possible I could spend all the currency I generate to push the build be able to do Ubers at the late stages of the league . Managed to take down Uber Shaper during Tota. Uber bosses are only secondary goal. If I have enough money and time I could respec to a 3rd build . tl:dr Looking for league starter and mid league builds that can farm Legion and Breach for currency. Restrictions are a single character with respec option. No time to level up second character. You definitely want to play spell for automatic chest opening. WOrb is my favorite for legion. Tornado shot deadeye. Nothing compares for legion farming. LA levelling through the campaign is the smoothest I have ever experienced and switched to TS right after killing Kitava. It also scales better than almost any other build in the game with investment so can be used in the endgame to kill Ubers, although this requires significant investment where the sky is the limit. What is your preferred currency farming method after campaign? isn't TS super high floor investment to get working? Last league, I was making a cold dot to ignite vortex with breach / deli / legion ( for cold dot), was pretty chill once you go to ignite, just walk and everything dies around you. I guess LA/KB into TS. Both elemental bow and physical CF should do fine. Ele LA/TS will have a better time against bosses, though. I'm personally going to start LA with legion/breach in mind If bow builds don?셳 get giga nerfed, play LA into TS like everyone else. You?셝 need a lot of investment to comfortably do ubers, though, so you?셪l need a to farm a bunch.  The latter build gets damage extremely cheaply, while being able to tank some attacks from ubers . Depending on if you want to keep doing legion/breach after you?셱e ready for ubers, you could do CF champ into Splitting Steel champ . I did quite a bit of Legion farming last league (usually Dunes, big open layout with usually good monolith placement) on an Icicle Mines Trickster, would highly recommend. Scales well into a Rathpith + Dissolution setup. If I had to do it again, I'd probably play it as either Deadeye for more movement / projectile speed or Assassin for just straight damage to push the Atlas faster. EK ignite is great for it, just make sure you pick the caster mastery for the chest opening, I would honestly not do breach without that and it?셲 also very nice for legion. You can play CF KB Champ,clears great and has a more defensive approach than LA Deadeye. Though LA is the premium choice right now for that content Ignite-prolif Chieftain build Referring to Mathil's build Hitting new highs every day Lets go Lets aim for a 4digit figure 110 Lets go NVDA NVDA NVDA Earnings TODAY! Guys, it's finally time. NVIDIA's earnings report is today - after hours. I'm sitting here waiting on what they have to say regarding their new AI developments. Despite the recent shakeups in AI leadership and the U.S. government's tightened chip export rules, NVIDIA seems unfazed, hitting a new all time high. The hot topic for NVIDIA's management this earnings call will be their strategies to overcome supply constraints and cater to the soaring demand. The analysts are fixed on an expected revenue of $16.2 billion for the October quarter, with adjusted EPS hitting $3.37. The anticipation ramps up for the current quarter, with revenue estimates at a whopping $18.0 billion.  NVIDIA's shares have been on a bullish ride, up 2.3% at $504.20 on Monday . Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar reaffirms a $620 price target on NVIDIA shares . The key challenge is the supply of GPUs, which are literally the lifeblood of NVIDIA's dominance . Their GPUs, crucial for parallel computations needed in AI model training, are at the forefront of the AI revolution. The high-end H100, launched earlier this year, quickly turned into a sought-after resource, thanks to the burgeoning interest in generative AI. The announcement of the H200 Tensor Core GPU, expected in Q2 2024, is already stirring talks of a new wave of demand. NVIDIA's pace in releasing chips is also noteworthy. Moving from a two-year to a one-year product cycle for AI chips, NVIDIA is set to unleash more high-end AI products in 2024 and 2025. This strategy could be a game-changer in maintaining their market dominance. In the backdrop of NVIDIA's stock hitting a record high of $504.09 per share, the upcoming earnings report is more than just numbers. It's a snapshot of NVIDIA's stronghold in the 2023 AI narrative. Here's a quick look at what Wall Street expects versus last year's performance: Revenue: $16.1 billion expected, a significant leap from $5.93 billion in Q3 last year. Adjusted EPS: $3.36 expected, up from $0.58 in Q3 last year. Data center revenue: $12.82 billion expected, a major jump from $3.83 billion in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue: Expected to hit $2.7 billion, up from $1.57 billion. Amidst these projections, the fourth quarter revenue guidance is critical, with expectations set at $17.8 billion. NVIDIA has been shattering expectations, and Wall Street is eager to see if this trend continues. However, not all is smooth sailing. The stock experienced a hiccup post-August report as valuation concerns and China's chip restrictions posed challenges. NVIDIA's SEC filing indicates minimal near-term impact from these restrictions, and analysts like Stifel's Ruben Roy expect similar reassurances in the earnings call. NVIDIA's role as a market momentum driver is undeniable. As a member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla, NVIDIA has helped propel the collective gains of these giants by over 70% this year. Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel's advice to investors: brace for ""post-NVDA volatility,"" as the stock's performance post-earnings could set the tone for the market. In essence, it's NVIDIA's world, and we're just trading in it.  Due to the high strike price, NVDA calls are a little too expensive for an ""earning"" play . So I'm gonna suggest a call spread . What type of call spread would we need for max profit? I'd grab a NVDA 11/24 500c for 1830 and sell the 525c for 905 . This basically means  With previous earnings, it's moved way more than 5% on average, so this should be an okay bet . Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice . I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play . TL;DR: 1. NVIDIA's earnings report is today. !banbet NVDA -10% 2D My life savings are on the line so you better be right Looks like you?셪l need to start saving again??$NVDA Theta gang rejoice They better blow it out of the waters or its not gonna hold up imo. Avg ER or even a good one and I think its gonna gap down tom. 16bil revenue for a 1.2T valuation is a joke, this has to meet reality at some point.  OpenAI is a line item of pushing the current aspect of AI now but not something they feel is a requisite aspect of their growth and capabilities . This bodes well for all chipmakers really . All in all, CHIPS are the most important thing to all of this AI. The strategy is to accelerate compute, drive down costs and increase throughput. Expand the reach of GAI. Update: GRACEHOPPER is 35000 parts WOW. Weighs 70Lbs and and everything about it is super complex. To install it is complex. You need a super computer just to test it. Update: Jensen talks RAG and how GRACEHOPPER is going to be so vital to the inference application building for GAI. VS and Search DB's effectively run better on this and they are seeing super strong demand.  AI factories need to generate infercing tokens of AI and they are seeing tremendous growth for chatbots and copilots . Other countries need their own data and culture to create their own AI's . InfiniBand is profoundly important for AI factories.> InfiniBand is a channel-based fabric that facilitates high-speed communications between interconnected nodes. We're at beginning at this reflection point/transition.

2023-11-27,"Continuing to pick up 33 Thats cheap Pick it up Intel to place US$14 billion orders with TSMC, says report If true it's not necessarily bad news for AMD. There are a few positives as well. Intel's comeback always hinged on them getting their fabs in order and offering a better process. Using a 3rd party fab for most of their product is a capitulation. Instead of competing on the process, Intel will only be able to compete on architecture. this means similar clocks (no more high clocks thanks to Intel's proprietary metal layers), they will have to use the same process as AMD. same or similar cost to AMD to make these chips, so no inherent advantage of running your own fabs. $15B going to TSMC is $15B not going towards Intel's own fab advancement. I think Intel is trying to keep their own fabs running with customer designs, but this will be a difficult task. Those fabs if not fully utilized will hemorrhage money. And Intel can't demand top dollar for the inferior process. Intel's CPUs will likely become more competitive in terms of perf/watt but will cost more, and will likely be slower. This is IDM 2.0 in action. Design and manufacturing are decoupling. Manufacturing will have a reportable P&L in 2024. The design teams will be incentivised to choose the best foundry available now that mfg. has to maintain a customer-supplier relationship. Intel designs still use internal advanced packaging capacity for EMIB and Foveros. This is to AMD's benefit for the next few years as Intel is still building out capacity. I can't see Intel hanging onto market share without the full capabilities of their scale as an IDM. Chipzilla will be looking much smaller in 2024, I think. It appears that Intel is looking to ""subsidize"" its own fab development by keeping pace with AMD's cadence, and utilising similar (if not better) TSMC fab tech. I.e. preventing a complete enterprise/client/ consumer cpu sales meltdown and using monies received to keep itself upright.  This begs the question - do they have upcoming archs that may keep pace or step ahead of AMD? Im speculating here, I havent kept up with white papers or all of their recent updates . Maybe they have something up their sleeves . If they do, then a similar/better node utilisation at TSMC will screw AMD sales a Great news, intel is doomed if they think the can keep a dividend, a fab business AND outsource cpus to TSMC. We don?셳 care much for Intel margins or dividend. Does nothing for AMD share price. This seems bad news for AMD, how will they cope for enough wafers this way? Is TSMC building so much extra capacity? Quite the knee fall for all those nodes in all these years. Once again, you just can't trust anything from lying Pat. IMHO AMD has the cheaper to produce product. Their chiplet approach is cheaper and their cores are better and smaller. Whatever Intel does with those wafers AMD has better and cheaper products. For now at least.  Intel's outsourcing of more tiles, including for the first time the CPU tile, could be a hedge . Pulling ahead of AMD to become TSMC's second largest customer seems at odds with Intel's goals for IFS 2.0 . Agree. Only one of the two things can be right: Intel outsourcing $10B worth of orders to TSMC Intel is on track for 5 nodes in 4 years I mean this seems to be the easiest way for Intel to harm string amd while also reaching /maintaining parity from technology pov. Just needed a few years to make to make it acceptable to outsource their cpus given the market realities.  AMD could be relegated to #4 and have to continue to fight for capacity to gain (keep?) market share . Between nVidia and Intel a lot of capacity can be consumed . AMD might be able to soon challenge Apple for #1 TSMC customer position . I dont think this is an issue due to wsas. Tsmc will build out the capacity their partners need per their wsas. I do not believe intel will be able to eat amds wafers unless a scenario appears where both amd and intel need wafers above what their wsas guarantee, and intel outbids amd for said wafers.  AMD has a comfortable market share already in server chips . For lower margin high volume products, it doesn't make sense to suppose Intel can outbid wafers that AMD is securing for server . Intel will look real bad for margins . Console manufacturers should be more concerned given the importance of keeping costs down. It makes sense for them to try and leverage Samsung. Also I doubt Intel can sustain it - it's bad enough they need to fund their own fabs, never mind paying premium prices for wafers on top of this (AMD can afford to pay more for wafers, on the simple basis they don't have fabs to fund). I have and currently share the exact same concerns. Im guessing lots of people here feel the same is this why AMD is moving to Samsung for future nodes? TSMC capacity has been bought up? That is alarming, even though it shows Intels weakness This is N3B which only Apple and Intel are customers of. N3B is apparently not IP-compatible with N3E. Everyone else will be ramping on N3E. Intel is not squeezing TSMC capacity to keep AMD out. They would have to buy much, much more and even then, advanced packaging is done internally and Intel doesn't have the capacity. AMD's use of Samsung is supposedly an entry-level Zen 5c APU, codenamed Sonoma Valley. It's always good to diversify your supply. AMD needs a cheap supplier to compete with Intel at the low-end. Meteor Lake is too expensive for Intel to bring it to the low-end in any meaningful volume, so AMD will mostly compete against Raptor Lake and Alder Lake refreshes/excess.  Intel's reliance on TSMC for fabrication suggests a pivot from their traditional strategy of leading with their fabrication capabilities . This levels the playing field somewhat, as both Intel and AMD will be relying on a third-party fabricator . Intel investing heavily in TSMC doesn't just mean a shared playing field; it also implies a diversion of resources away from question is: how much will amd award tsmc next year when the revenue goes to the moon ? Isn't this bad for us? Because node becomes a level playing field? Let me guess, 13th gen++? TSMC ADR vs TSMC actual stock May I ask what is the difference between the TSMC ADR (NYSE: TSM ) and the actual stock listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange ( TPE: 2330 )? Below is a Bloomberg COMP screen. The difference in returns is 33.90% for the last 10 years. You don't see such a substantial difference for other ADRs. You can see the line diverges from time to time. Please note that the difference isn't explained by the USD/TWD exchange rate, because I have converted both in USD to make it an apple-to-apple comparison. For comparison, below is the AMD Depositary Receipt listed on the German Exchanges vs the actual AMD listed on NASDAQ. The difference is just 0.04% and the price lines follow each other very closely. Obviously, a big part is explained by the supply-demand. There is a limited number of ADRs available and investors bid them higher. But I am wondering if there are other factors that I am missing (premium for the political situation maybe?)  In most cases, Depositary Receipts (DRs) are fungible . This means they can be exchanged between markets . Arbitrageurs (usually institutional investors) long the stock in the market where it's undervalued . They then convert the stock from one form to the other (from ADR to home country stock or vice versa)  In the case of TSM US, ""re-issuance is not allowed"" (see https://emops.twse.com.tw/server-java/t58 query) This means you cannot covert 2330 TT into TSM U (this process is called ""Create ADR"") This restriction only permits one-way  China's A-shares (listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen) exhibit striking price differences, sometimes exceeding 100% for the same company . The underlying principle driving these price gaps is the absence of an effective arbitrage mechanism . Great insight. Thanks a lot. I will have to ponder whether this one-way conversion poses any risks to holding TSM US. What would happen during a tail-event with the ADR.  I know its an old post but i try my luck. Im new to investinging and i just found out about the 2 different stocks. I bought the adr one, and im wondering if the other one would be better for me. Are there any pros or cons other than them being fungible? Just curious if there was ever an answer on this question? The current spread in the pricing seems strange to me - about $4 per share less on Taiwan exchange. I believe I answered the question. It's because it's not fungible. I have auTiSM and I like the stock a lot and I will never sell my TSM great q - did you come to any conclusions? Wondering if it could be something as simple as market accessibility. If it's a lot easier to buy ADR for int'l investors (assumption), it could drive up price over-time. As I type thought that just feels off - you'd think that'd get quickly adjusted for.",4

2023-11-29,Headed for hell but dramatically rebounds woah The guidance wasnt bad but the cost increased more than expected why Riot why? The amount of times I have seen someone complaining about this visual glitch is greater than VALORANTS size What the hell happened Look at the valorant... It's not actually that big. Just some bug in windowsxvalorant ig. Mine says 3.6 TB whereas I have a 512 GB SSD lmao Yeah it take around 40 gb space There is supposedly a corrupted file. It only expands in storage from there its also a visual glitch but it means there is a corrupted file POV:- u dont know valorant is free and download it from a cheapass website,-4

Are they getting payed by NVIDIA and intel to bash on amd or do they have something personally against the company? I just don???understand what their motivation would be Most likely, it's a personal dislike. UB is banned from nearly all tech subs to include r/intel and r/Nvidia and theres never been any evidence of payments on behalf of either of these companies to the site. A better question would be, why is a garbage site like Userbenchmark ranked so highly by google? The owner's really good at SEO apparently, and Google's algorithm isn't smart enough to know people only keep talking about it because it's so bad Literally nobody knows, it's one of the greatest mysteries of our time.

Now many years later, with a permanent and horrible disfigurement on his face from that accident, he is on a mission of justice and honor to forever rid the world of the OSHA incompliant fiend that is AMD, and its Neanderthal fiendling army or trolls. The owner/developer is mentally ill. Not even a professional paid shill would write and produce things like they do, they're just unhinged and greedy. Yeah, a real paid shill would make it seem as unbiased and fair as possible to make it seem legit. They showed me on the doll where AMD touched them, and it was not a nice place. Jerry Sanders did beautiful things with the founder's mother. im 100% certain a AMD executive banged the wife of the guy who created userbenchmark.",2

New Feature Highlights New Game Support Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora THE FINALS NEW AMD Software UI Redesign ??The Home and Gaming tab have undergone a UI redesign in this latest update of AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition. HYPR-RX profiles can now be enabled easily on a global basis, or per-game on the Home Tab; additionally, games on the Home tab now will display key art for a more vibrant experience When users go to the Graphics section within the Gaming tab, they will be able to learn more about specific features in each HYPR-RX profile by clicking on individual features to display a content block that contains more information about what benefits each feature enables Now when you view your performance metrics in AMD Software, you can choose to customize elements such as the background or text colours, default enabled metrics through profiles, as well as select options such as showing the metrics overlay only while a game is open. Introducing: AMD HYPR-RX Eco ??designed with power savings in mind, when HYPR-RX Eco is enabled, AMD Software will enable a suite of features for gamers to experience power savings with one click HYPR-RX Eco will launch initially with support for Radeon????7000 Series graphics support and RDNA????3 platforms Expanded OpenGL Interop Support - AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 23.12.1 expands support for FRTC, Radeon??Super Resolution, Overlay, Record and Stream features to OpenGL games. Additional OS Feature Support Support for Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling for Radeon RX 7900/7800/7700 series GPUs. Click HERE for more information. Additional SDK Support Additional Vulkan吏?extensions. Click HERE for more information. Fixed Issues Improvements to high idle power when using select dual monitor display setups with mixed resolutions and high refresh rate displays (such as 1440p @ 120/144Hz + 1080p @ 120/144Hz or 2160p @ 120/144Hz + 1080p @ 120/144Hz) on Radeon??RX 7000 series GPUs. Intermittent micro-stuttering may be experienced when running Chromium-based browsers on systems that pair a Radeon??RX 7000 series GPU with a secondary display connected to an AMD Ryzen??7000 series processor. Stars may intermittently fail to appear while playing Crysis Remastered. Certain textures may become invisible while playing Final Fantasy X HD Remaster on Radeon??RX 7000 series GPUs. Intermittent corruption may be observed on the racetrack while playing EA Sports WRC. Intermittent stutter while playing Overwatch 2 on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon??RX 6900 XTX. Known Issues Audio may intermittently become out of sync with video when recording from AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition with AV1 codec. Intermittent grey screen after driver upgrade with certain monitors (such as Nixeus NX-EDG274K) on Radeon??RX 7000 series GPUs. Performance drop may be observed in some DirectML workloads. Graphics API metric may show as N/A in certain UWP applications. Intermittent flickering of certain ground textures may be observed while playing War Thunder with 4x SAAA enabled on some AMD Graphics Products, such as the Radeon??RX 7900 XTX. Important Notes Starting in January, AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition driver releases will no longer support AMD Link. This move will allow AMD to put more focus on developers with our SDKs such as the AMD Advanced Media Framework that allow them to enable streaming functionality within their solutions. Gamers can continue to use AMD Link until then. Click HERE for more information. Factory Reset has been temporarily disabled as a precautionary measure while we address isolated installation issues that have been reported during PC upgrades. Users may use AMD Cleanup Utility as a temporary option. For users who previously installed an AMD Software insider preview driver, running AMD Cleanup Utility is recommended before installing this driver. Graphics profiles and performance metrics setting mays may be adjusted after upgrading from previous AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition driver versions. Users experiencing issues may use the settings reset option in either the graphics or performance metrics page to recover to default settings. Still no DX12 drivers timeout fix... unbelivable... Surprised that they just straight up leaked that The Finals is releasing this week. Playing the beta like a month ago the game seemed pretty much finished aside from balancing Hmm The Finals so does that mean its getting a release this month I had so much fun playing that in the playtest. My Time Spy benchmark went up 500pts with Adrenalin 23.12.1 over 23.11.1 Nothing interesting for RDNA2? RX 6900 XTX ? Good catch! Too bad its prolly just a typo, but man I wish AMD would let the 6000 series get all the 7000 series software goodies. day 5000 of hoping windows/adrenalin stops resetting my gpu presets to default whenever i reboot. Simple fix for that, disable fast startup in Windows Power Options. ho. ly. shit. They finally fixed the bug preventing me from being able to open adrenalin since 23.9.1. I was losing hope they were ever going to address that. RIP AMD Link.. damn They say that HYPR-RX Eco is RDNA3 only yet I can select it on per game basis on 6750XT, although apparently all it does is enable Anti-Lag. Personally I don't really see the point of using this ""eco"" mode on desktop, I'd undervolt if I wanted to save energy. Hags isn't showing in windows settings after the update 23.12.1 7900XTX Windows 11 Edit: fix was to update to win11 23h2 Introducing: AMD HYPR-RX Eco ??designed with power savings in mind While we're being power conscious, maybe we could get a way to reduce the power limit further on RDNA cards? Currently I can set the power limit on my 6800 XT to -6% at best, while my older Radeon cards could do -50%. Reducing the power limit by 25% on my Vega 64 was a nice and easy way to reduce heat output during the summer without having to fiddle with under-clocking and under-volting. Does this update provide any new features for 6000 series GPUs, or is everything exclusive to 7000 series? Still nothing on Anti-Lag+. I guess this feature will become meaningless for multiplayer games coming forward I feel like that was a massive fuckup on their end. They paid expensive engineers a fuck load of money to hack into game engines then immediately got slapped down by multiple anticheat systems for them to figure you can't touch engine code without permission. The proper way to do it is inside the engine itself, meaning amd has to make an interface and kindly request developers to implement it. Doing that takes time, so I doubt it'll be back any time soon.

2023-12-07,"$AMD shares up 8% following rollout of new MI300 AI chips AMD shares surged over 8% after the launch of its latest AI chip, the Instinct MI300, with major players like Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI set to utilize it. AMD CEO Lisa Su hailed the MI300 as the world's highest-performance accelerators for generative AI. The company forecasted MI300 sales to bring in $2 billion in revenue for 2024. https://www.investopedia.com/amd-stock-surges-with-microsoft-meta-and-openai-set-to-use-its-latest-ai-chip-8411853 Basically it dropped from $123ish to $117ish before the announcement yesterday. Currently at $128. 52 week high is $132. Notably, there was no significant market reaction yesterday after the announcement, during market hours. A day later, market decides it was good. (There were a couple modest upgrades I believe, but that doesn't usually move a stock too much.) The competition has begun. I hope it can break Nvidia domination, so companies have more options in the market. Everyone keeps talking about how Jensen's planning is always 5 years ahead of the competition. Now is the time to prove it. Will be interesting to see how this plays out. I wish I could be more excited about this AI hype, but just can't get rid of the sense that we are getting way ahead of ourselves. It's reasonable to think that the real money won't move until there's at least 1 PowerPoint made for Fund managers explaining what all the gobbledygook means.

2023-12-11,"Suggestions for thriving after the move to corporate Hello! I made the shift to a job in corporate (EU, semiconductors, experienced hire, corporate strategy within the company) after spending 3 years in a boutique strategy firm quite big in my country. My biggest concern is not to get stuck and keep up the growth, both in terms of salary and responsabilities. Do you have any advice on this and all other kind of suggestions for facing the shift from consulting? Thank you!  In consulting, your boss is always shifting and the client is often the ultimate authority . However, in corporate, your direct manager is both of those things in one . There are far fewer opportunities to demonstrate skills and values independently outside your direct management team . Suggestion: look for work for someone who has prior experience in consulting and can speak the same language as you. Edit: made more clear my point about evaluation That sounds reasonable, thank you. But why would you say that my direct manager would have zero say in my evaluation?

I would say to look out for the big dog. If he wants a yes man, be a yes man. If not, don't be a yes man. Until the end of the year Lets aim for 140 [Ars Technica] The race between Intel, Samsung, and TSMC to ship the first 2 nm chip What does 2nm even mean anymore in terms of transistor density, performance per watt, and other metrics ? That is a great point. The problem is that its not a defined. There was claims that like Intel's actual density was better even though it was a higher NM compared to TSMC's claim. So there should be a universal metric for something like density, chip size, wattage, etc At the same token in order to imprint on a wager a 2nm chip is amazing technology itself. So although a large NM size may have better stats the pure ability to do a 2nm imprint on the wafer is impressive as is. Ribbon FET, Gate all around GAA, or stacked transistors. It is just the next step. Intel 7 did not use EUV. TSMC N7 did not use EUV. Intel 4 and TSMC N5, N6, and maybe N7+ used some EUV. i read something that it's really no more than a model number these days. Like the Model T car, this is the Model 2nm of fabrication, it has nearly zero relation with 2 nanometers What happens after 1nm, serious question. Intel is moving to Angstroms (20A, 18A process). 1A=0.1nm Iirc, even at 3 nm, a transistor size is still around 60 nm3 . These numbers lie. It?셲 just marketing. A better number is ?쐔ransitory density??but even then that number can be misleading because transistors are just a small part. All the interconnects and other gates take up a significant amount of room and reducing those sizes also is incredibly important. So we are no where near transistors being just a few atoms. But when we do, then we need to find some new base for computers or computer hardware will be less generic and a lot more specialized. What happens after this are other ways to increase density - backside power delivery, stacking p and n-type transistors on top of each other, 2D materials, glass substrates, gallium nitride... there's plenty of new things to keep Intel busy. The case for smaller is like the GHz race around 2000. Everyone wants to be first, but it doesn't mean there will be a immediate benefit. It?셲 very important to Intel and tsmc, etc, who have to market these advancements to the rest of the sector. People need to stop beating this drum. There's nothing intrinsically 10 nm about Intel 10ESF / Intel 7. Even the article explains this. 2 nm is just shorthand for a node with characteristics expected from N2 / 18A / 2SF.  Intel will be shipping Intel 4 in just two days on mobile . They're not overselling it, since it's only around TSMC N6 . There's nothing inherently 10nm about what is now called Intel 7 . Didn't Intel just announce Meteor Lake on Intel 4 (equivalent to TSMC 4nm) a couple weeks ago?
Intel also claims their 2nm equivalent ""20A"" will launch in 2024. Though there is speculation it's more of a 3nm competitor. Unless 15th gen is on 2nm...but probably 3nm",4

If they miss that window it will be 2026. AMD and Nvidia usually trails Apple by 1-2 years. I wonder if AMD and Nvidia are starting to take more risk and ask for early access and allocation now. If AMD and Nvidia won?셳 have N2 until 2026-27 that sort of gives Intel a chance to catch up on process. Something to pay close attention to if investment timeframe is more than 2 years I doubt nvidia can get satisfactory yields if they keep with 800 dies to do early adoption. amd should be able to. I mean isnt that expected? N3 was only this year, so there was zero chance N2 would be in 2024. TSMC actually makes reasonable claims. Not Intel ?? nodes in 5 years?? Actually with INTC's N3 order from TSM, they've already caught up on process. Have they not?

2 Exit AMD FidelityFX??Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3)  I cant wait for modders to begin releasing FSR 3 for non supported titles . I just came from a 3060ti to a 6900XT and its been pretty great so far . Really need this in Diablo IV ASAP. It would be a perfect fit for the new 90hz Steam Deck. Minecraft with FSR3 will be goat lol I've been using it in the new Avatar game and its actually way better than FSR 2. I wish more games would update, especially Cyberpunk. I've been using FSR 2.1 in there but it doesn't look right to me. I know jack shit about game development or anything like it. Is FSR 3 a quick addition to make? If a game already has FSR 2 in it is it a simple fileswap for the game devs? Just wondering if all these devs are just lazy and not doing a 1 hour task or whatever to update FSR 1/2 to FSR 3. Or if this is something that might take a dev team a week+ worth of work to get functioning.  A normal dev will have to do a dev test to make sure nothing blew up before releasing to production . Then production to sign off and hand off to QA, then QA have their wily ways with it for days/week before a release . Just wondering if all these devs are just lazy and not doing a 1 hour task or whatever to update FSR 1/2 to FSR 3. It's not a question of laziness, but budgets. Even if it's ""just"" a DLL swap, quality control will be needed, and you're quickly looking at several hours if not an entire workday if any bugs pop up. Not a game developer, but I work in software. Even if FSR 3 is something that takes 1 developer an hour to implement, a game studio not releasing the feature is probably not due to developers being lazy.  With a widespread change like FSR 3 (specifically frame gen), any kind of regression testing would need to be extensive . They are then paying for developer time to implement, and QA for testing which can be costly . If the game runs well enough by the game studios standards, they have no real incentive to release unnecessary features . This is just what I speculate since games are also just software. Cool feature releases and deciding what goes out to production is usually outside of the control of actual developers and are decisions usually made by management, team leads, and business analysts. This is at least stuff I experience at my job. There have been cases where I want to make technical improvements to our systems, but management doesn't want to spend resources on regression testing because the software works well enough as is. FSR3 allows the UI to be on a separate plane (though arguably a requirement imo), might be difficult for some depending on how they've implemented their UI. It???a cool feature, wish games would use it or adopt it rapidly. Been hearing about this for ages and the big launch seems lackluster Finally , BG3 and i bet many other games waited just for this to happen. Cyberpunk and Baldur's Gate let's gooo. Is there a way for end users to replace fsr versions? AMD FSR3 framegen is confirmed to be supported on the Xbox Series X|S consoles too, that???going to be huge I think! It can potentially make a massive difference on framerates on the Xbox Series X & S consoles. Hopefully we'll see some mods released that take advantage of this now the SDK is available. We gonna see Skyrim gonna have more lasting mods now. Nice! Maybe we'll get some mods that replace DLSS FG with FSR FG now. Nice, hopefully gets modded into Cyberpunk soon or an official release Now somebody mod it into Witcher 3 so I can start whacking drowners at 300fps. Xmas is really early, I mean shit ton of amazing OpenSource models, now FINALLY this FSR3 thing, and it is still getting better everywhere it seems! What a time to be alive! Now we're cooking with Crisco! Now we can get FG mods until the official implementations roll around.

Long-term outlook hinges on successful execution of strategic initiatives. Intel unveils new AI chip to compete with Nvidia and AMD Intel?셲 total revenue in Q3 2023 was $14.2 billion, marking an 8% decrease from Q3 2022. Intel Corporation, a global technology leader, has been at the forefront of innovation in the semiconductor industry. Founded in 1968, Intel?셲 contributions have been pivotal in the evolution of computing technologies. The company specializes in manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors, and network interface controllers, among others. Recent times have been a mix of challenges and opportunities for Intel. The company, once the undisputed leader in semiconductor technology, faces fierce competition from rivals like AMD and NVIDIA, who have made significant inroads into Intel?셲 market share. The rise of ARM-based processors and the increasing demand for specialized chips for AI and data centers add to the competitive pressure. Intel?셲 response to these challenges has been multi-pronged. The company has accelerated its innovation cycle, focusing on next-generation chip technologies. Under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel announced a significant investment in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, aiming to not only meet its own chip demands but also offer foundry services to other chipmakers. Moreover, Intel is actively diversifying its product portfolio. Its recent advancements in AI, edge computing, and autonomous driving technologies signify a strategic shift.   Leading AI models, such as OpenAI?셲 ChatGPT, predominantly utilize Nvidia GPUs hosted in cloud environments . This reliance has contributed to Nvidia's stock soaring by approximately 230% since the beginning of the year . AMD and Intel are now introducing their own chips, aiming to challenge Nvidia? Although specifics were sparse, Intel?셲 Gaudi3 is set to rival Nvidia?셲 H100, a popular choice for entities constructing extensive chip networks for AI operations, and AMD?셲 upcoming MI300X. The Gaudi3 is expected to begin distribution to clients in 2024. However, these strategic decisions come with their own set of risks. The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company?셲 ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years.  In Q3 2023, Intel reported a total revenue of $14.2 billion, a decrease of 8% from the same quarter in the previous year . This decline was primarily due to decreases in revenue across its major segments . The company?셲 financial strategy also reflects a commitment to operational efficiency and cost management. By streamlining processes and optimizing resources, Intel aims to improve its profitability and shareholder value in the long term. This approach is crucial as the company faces intense competition from other tech giants and emerging players in the semiconductor industry. In conclusion, Intel?셲 recent financial performance, though marked by challenges, showcases the company?셲 strategic efforts to remain a dominant player in the tech industry. The company?셲 focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and market adaptability will be key to its future success and financial stability. Revenue (Q3 2023): $14.2 billion, down 8% YoY. Client Computing Group Revenue: Decreased by 3%. Data Center and AI Group Revenue: Decreased by 10%. Network and Edge Group Revenue: Decreased by 32%. Gross Margin (Q3 2023): 42.5%, slightly down from 42.6% YoY. Net Income (Q3 2023): $297 million, a substantial decline from $1.019 billion YoY. Earnings Per Share (Q3 2023): $0.07, with non-GAAP EPS at $0.41. Intel?셲 business model revolves around its dominance in CPUs, with expansion into data center solutions, IoT, and AI. The company?셲 shift towards providing foundry services marks a strategic expansion of its business scope. Competitors like AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM pose significant challenges. AMD?셲 gains in the CPU market and NVIDIA?셲 dominance in GPUs and AI chips have encroached on Intel?셲 turf. ARM?셲 energy-efficient architecture is increasingly favored for mobile devices and is making inroads into servers, a traditional Intel stronghold. Intel?셲 response lies in its comprehensive product range, manufacturing capabilities, and R&D investments. The company?셲 ability to innovate and adapt to market trends will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge. Strengths: Strong brand, diverse product portfolio, manufacturing capabilities. Weaknesses: Margin pressures, high competition, execution risks on strategic shifts. Opportunities: Growth in AI, autonomous tech, and data centers. Threats: Rapid technological changes, competitive market dynamics, global economic uncertainties. Intel?셲 future performance hinges on its ability to innovate and adapt to market trends. The company?셲 investment in AI and IoT, along with its strategic focus on foundry services, positions it well for future growth. After conducting a comprehensive 10-year forecast, our analysis indicates that Intel?셲 current valuation appears to be justifiable, taking into account a range of scenarios. These scenarios are grounded in conservative (low), moderate (mid), and optimistic (high) financial assumptions, providing a robust framework for evaluating the company?셲 long-term potential.  Intel?셲 journey will be a testament to its adaptability and resilience in an ever-evolving tech landscape . For investors, keeping a keen eye on Intel?Å� execution of its ambitious plans will be crucial . Reddit be so wild, it'll ignore cheap stocks until after they raise +50%. I remember the ""Intel is dead"" posts from the months prior. Yes.. and when it was announced dead. I bought 150 shares at $31.35. It was so dead. Way undervalued. Going to explode. She also sold NVDA before it skyrocketed It seems like the power is leaving Lets get rich okay Lets all buy the rising stocks Nvidia rushes to deliver modified AI GPU chips to China customers, allegedly places 'Super Hot Run' priority order with TSMC Maybe they need to sell 4090d before 4090 is allowed in china again / china find some way to circumvent this thing .. but tbh any one who needs a 4090d should have gotten a 4090 by now Why don't they just ban AD102? Ban a specific chip and they'll just make a new chip with a new number that does the exact same thing. They need to ban specific categories of hardware, such as all GPUs above a certain level of processing power, or all GPUs with memory pooling functionality. They can?셳 be specific. That is anticompetitive It's completely legal according to US govt rules, not sure why they getting angry. This is what happens when politics mixes with policy wonks who don't understand the technology. I suspect They want Nvidia to stop providing ad102 gpus of their own Accord without an outright ban as not to spur the Chinese to retaliate. I imagine US lawmakers are in two camps.one say to allow Chinese enterprise to buy cut down tech so they don't develope indigenous tech. And another is an outright ban and risk reprisal, and force the Chinese to waste money on an ultimately failed/lacking tech? basically a repate of the east Germany processor industry. They?셱e angry because nvidia is exploiting loopholes clearly not intended by the legislators. And nvidia knows that, that?셲 why they?셱e rushing the production so they can make the delivery before the loophole is closed (which it will any day) Uh, isn't this just the regular production ramp for the Super refresh coming Q1 2024? Super Hot Run... And anything H100/H200-based Nvidia has already ordered as much as they could get, and would just need to bin down for China. Ah, so they will never officially ban it outright to avoid retaliation, but they will still do every other thing in principle that counts as a ban. Got it. Some forward thinking right there. China must be such a $Big market for Nvidia to ignore",2

2023-12-20," ""HBM is a more complex product - it's, in fact, the most complex product that has ever been High-bandwidth memory (HBM) is one of Micron's most profitable products, in part because of the technical complexity involved in its construction, Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana said in an interview with Reuters. ""HBM is a more complex product - it's, in fact, the most complex product that has ever been designed in the DRAM industry,"" he said. Dec 20 (Reuters) -Micron Technology MU.O forecast quarterly revenue above market estimates on Wednesday, and its shares jumped nearly 5% in extended trading on signs of memory chip recovery in 2024 after one of the most significant downturns in years. Demand for flash storage and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) should keep improving next year, while at the same time supply will begin to approach historically normal levels, the memory chipmaker said. Memory prices, which slumped this year, will improve next year and rise further in 2025, Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a conference call. Micron forecast revenue of $5.3 billion, plus or minus $200 million, for the second quarter, compared with estimates of $5.03 billion, according to LSEG data. Micron said it expects the supply of chips for PCs, mobile devices and other chips to approach normal levels in the first half of next year. Micron is a closely watched chipmaker: it reports results that include two months of information ahead of companies that report results in January, and its memory products can be a signal for demand in other semiconductor markets. Businesses have begun to incorporate generative artificial intelligence into various products and services that have boosted demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory chips, which are necessary to train large language models that form the foundation of AI tech. ""Demand for AI servers has been strong as data center infrastructure operators shift budgets from traditional servers to more content-rich AI servers,"" Micron Data center operators are shifting purchases to AI chips that require more member from traditional servers, Mehrotra said.

Rambus up 0.5 B today in market cap Micron up $5 B today Only a matter of time for some trickle down to come to Netlist I would hope that Netlist would do better not on trickle down but based on intellectual property it has created. By the logic of Netlist's chip design becoming recognized why isn't Netlist a more valuable company. Is it merely unrecognized by investors and competitors or are its designs nothing special  Their tech has been stolen for so long that it just seems to be common practice to just steal it and not pay for it . The legal system has done nothing for years about this except let appeals just drag on for years and I have no faith in the system to do anything different now as back then . Perhaps there will be some justice in 2024. The legal system has been very accommodative to huge corps G M and SS. A few of the judges were honest. Good luck to all. I need your help about random blackscreens Hello! I have my pc since February 2023 now, and it's been 10 months where i have totally random blackscreens on different games, i'm used to solve my problems alone about my pc's but this time, i dont have a clue about what could be the problem. Those blackscreens are completely random, a friend of mine got the exact same GPU at the same time and have exact same problems aswell, he did send his gpu back to the manufacturer but the GPU came back from RMA after being tested and has been considered totally functional(note that he have no problems at all when he revert his GPU to his old rtx 2060). The following games are the games where i remember having the MOST blackscreens (Escape from Tarkov, World of Warcraft, 7 days to die) i can't remember having blackscreens elsewhere or on the games that i play the most beside those games (Path of Exile for example). The only game that gave me a clear error message about this issue was BeamNG, saying that the gpu could not respond or has been unplugged. I tried reinstalling my drivers, disabling default power saving modes, changing cable and more ... I can run OCCT tests during hours without having any issues Temps are always good (Note that when the problem happens, the things that happens on my pc are the similar things that happens when the video driver crashes, it closes Discord, video games etc, it's not just a signal loss) My pc have the following specs : Operating System Windows 11 Professional (X64) 22H2 Installation date: 7/5/2022 Processor Intel Core i5 13600KF clocked at 5.10 GHz Measured frequency (core0): 5.10 GHz Number of cores: 6+8 physical, 12+8 logical Socket: Socket 1700 LGA CPU temperature (core 0): 39 째C Motherboard ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.

It's kind of funny to see this as I've been getting black screened on my 3080 on World of Warcraft for the last few months and couldn't seem to fix it, but I think I just found a solution for my problem a few hours ago. Download MSI Afterburner and set the power limit of the GPU to 75%, then hit apply. I probably just have a shitty or failing PSU since mine is a prebuilt, but if that fixes your problem at least you've got something working in the meantime. While you mentioned reinstalling drivers, ensure you're using the latest recommended version directly from NVIDIA's website, not just Windows Update. Sometimes, specific driver versions can have known issues or work better with certain hardware configurations. Try slightly underclocking your RTX 4070 Ti using tools like MSI Afterburner. This can sometimes help eliminate instability caused by high factory overclocks. Use GPU monitoring software like GPU-Z or HWMonitor to track temperatures, clock speeds, and power draw during gameplay. This can help identify if any spikes or unusual behavior coincide with the blackscreens. Although your description of the blackscreens suggests a GPU issue, ensure your power supply unit (PSU) has enough wattage to handle the demands of your hardware. A insufficient PSU can cause random crashes and blackouts. Clean Windows installation: As a last resort, consider performing a clean installation of Windows 11 to rule out any software conflicts or corruption. Move your computer to a different room and different furniture and see if the problem happens there. I'm a tech, why would a different location work? I can think of a few reasons, but those reasons have a very small chance that is what the issue is. Change your drivers or reinstall them. Samsung Electronics up today Microns sales",2
2023-12-21,"ASML ships first High-NA EUV machines to Intel It's notable that these machines halve the reticle size from 858 mm짼 to 429 mm짼. This means that stuff like Nvidia's GPUs with big dies (600+ mm짼) cannot be fabbed on nodes using High-NA EUV. Chiplets are undoubtedly the future of GPUs. And it's not just Nvidia GPUs. Apple's Mx Max chips also exceed 429 mm짼. This means eventually when Apple uses a node with High NA EUV, they will not be able to keep the Max chip monolithic. It will probably be two Pro dies 'glued' together, like how currently the M Ultra is two M Max chips glued together. Intel's foveros packaging seems to have been developed specifically with high-NA EUV in mind. Perhaps Meteor Lake is just the test bed?  Jony Srouji, Apple's lead chip wizard, said with node technology hitting certain slowdowns the future was in interesting packaging . While they sort of do it with UltraFusion, that's just two adjacent dies on a wafer, not total disaggregation like Meteor Lake . I'd be very interested to see M4 or M5 on tiles. For Intel these machines already make all the sense with Meteor Lake already shipping in mass for smaller tiles. i did not know this. interesting. so smartphone chips and desktop CPU etc. does this effect intels servers CPU too? i am not aware of the die size The reticle stays the same size, but the max die size is smaller at wafer level due to the optics (4 x magnification -> 4x in x and 8x in y). They can still make bigger dies by stitching exposure fields together. If they solve the issues with chiplets for gpu's. Will be interesting to see if AMD can gain an advantage with chiplets due to the reticle limit As I understand it though (And I'm no expert) this machine enables a process shrink to 2nm or less so wouldn't you essentially be able to take a die that is currently 600mm2, if made with 3nm EUV, and reduce it to 400mm2 ? And yes, I do understand that there is a lot more to the work than a simple shrink the die"""" That is $300 million dollars sitting on top of that one truck. Fab machines have literally doubled in price to go from 3 to 2 nanometer precision resolution. They are also expected to produce 12 times faster then machines 10 years ago. ASML ships groundbreaking new chipmaking tool to Intel ??High-NA lithography tool needed for next-gen process nodes could cost ~$400 million imagine that truck crashing $40,000,000 deductible. Especially if you cheaped out and didn't get the Collision Damage Waiver.

Max has 92 billion transistors and is I believe a 450 mm chip TSMC A14 will probably use HighNA EUV which halves the reticle limit from 858 mm to 429 mm This means that they are looking to fit 200 billion transistors in a monolithic chip that is no more than 429 mm We dont know that for sure This Cadence blog says that the largest 10 of designs will use the stitching together of two sets of

let alone TSMC to possess and qualify each one theyll need a healthy stock of these tools qualified by 2025 in order to certify it for that process in time to PRQ the process on that timeline On one hand its mindblowing that we may soon have 200 Billion transistor chips On the other hand its kinda sad how even old 200 million transistor chips could run most modern apps fine Were adding loads of cache and cores but the basic CPU architecture isnt evolving much at all Using transistor count is as misleading as the nanometer number Its better to think of the circuitry design as geometrical rather than discrete transistors The transistors are pretty much combined together in a certain shape that does not resemble transistor and takes up significantly less space than discrete mosfets of same process Time to build stoves with cpu heating plates They probably have to invent a mini AC to kept it cool Nanoscale water channels liquid nitrogen thermal transistors and other exotic stuff Sounds a lot like we are about to hit a wall in terms of transistor density as chiplets are a mere bandaid Unlike a die shrink they arent going to make a chip run cooler or more efficient If anything they will be more inefficient than monolithic dies Its a shame that even modern silicon cant be pushed beyond 45GHz without throwing efficiency out the window CPUs have already reached their peak frequency and even GPUs are now pushing 3GHz and will reach the 4GHz frequency limit in a few generations Beyond that weve got nothing not unless 1kW CPUs and GPUs become the norm In accordance with the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems IRDS 2022 Edition roadmap transistor density will increase from ten to twelve times between 2023 and 2037 Most of this growth in transistor count will occur after 2030 after a transition to a new scaling method utilising vertical monolithic architectures is achieved wherein by 2037 six CFET transistors will be stacked subsequently on top of each other irdsieeeorgimagesfilespdf20222022IRDSMMpdf Im guessing the absolute ceiling will be 3 angstroms for transistor size Its around the diameter of an atom The 1nm is not actually 1nm Its marketing based on how small planar process would need to be to compete with the FINFET process of this size Now with GAAFET the difference increases even more Not that that matters since well before true 5nm sizes we start having to deal with the unpredictable quantum effects and that makes these processes difficult even when not factoring limitations in manufacturing This guy doesnt know Thats a waferscale chip Each of those is like 100k not reasonable to be considered the benchmark It says monolithic chip which this is absolutely not This is 50 chiplets which have not been cut apart plus interconnects with massive design limitations compared to a true monolithic design The 1B chip is a nonmonolithic stacked design you could actually put on a PCIe card which this isnt either To all the INTC haters and future AMD bagholders Wow I was nervous about holding AMD and TSM until now Feel so much better thanks TSMC shit canned their Chairman this month because of the absolute shit show that

2023-12-27," Tesla reportedly taps TSMC to produce new CPU for autonomous driving . 3nm next-gen CPU may feature N3 HW4 is now old news. Time to speculate on what HW5 will bring.  TSMC's N3P process is a cutting-edge manufacturing technology that offers high performance, high transistor density, and relatively lower power . Several companies are reportedly committed to using production nodes, so Tesla will not be alone .  A previous report indicated that Tesla planned to use TSMC's N4 technology to build its Full Self-Driving Hardware 4 system-on-chip in Arizona sometime in 2024 . Meanwhile, since TSMC had to delay production at its Fab 21 to 2025, Tesla either decided to port its FSD 4 design to N3P and make it Anyone shocked by this would have believed Apple planned to stop making iPhones after they rolled out the iPhone 3G. In 10 years we will probably be on our 4th or 5th iteration of FSD Hardware. I mean cool. But tsmc fab space is fully booked for a while FSD isn?셳 just about software (ie v12) or chips (ie HW4 or HW5, although it always needed faster and more energy efficient chips due to how computer intensive Teslas are). It is also camera placement and dependability in various weather. I get cameras being blocked due to rain or dirt all the time. The front camera that detect rain is frequently off (wiping nothing or too slow).  Tesla should be using the data it collects to auto enhance and correct the mapping . It is also about mapping. I get navigation direction to be in the right two lanes, when actually I get in the left two lanes . Computers will have a harder time to correct this situation .  Tesla needs to figure out how to enable Sentry mode without draining the battery so much . Tesla should be able to park my car for 4-6 weeks in an airport lot without worry about running out of battery . This may require a separate gpu for sentry mode . Wow, a lot of people on this thread are pretty salty about a pending hardware upgrade. All tech hardware is constantly being upgraded. Apple, Google and Samsung are already planning their 2025 and 2026 phones. It would be more surprising if Tesla wasn't planning a new hardware revision. New FSD hardware doesn't instantly turn old FSD hardware into a paperweight. FSD 12.x, with end-to-end neural networks, runs faster on HW3 than FSD 11.x does. I expect we'll see other improvements in that area as the software becomes more efficient at making driving decisions.  A 2018 Tesla running FSD HW3 is the closest thing to a self-driving car you can buy right now . The fact that I can buy a five-year-old car for $25,000 is impressive all by itself . Sometimes doing something new that nobody else has successfully done before takes longer than you think while you're figuring it out. Another reason not to purchase FSD now. If you want to use it, get the monthly subscription because your car will eventually be obsolete. Hw1 didn?셳 work. Hw2 didn?셳 work. Hw2.5 didn?셳 work. Hw4 doesn?셳 work. Solution: HW5!!! /s This is just throwing mud to see if it sticks lol. 3NM production is extremely limited right now, taken up almost entirely by Apple, there's no way they can answer Tesla's production demand. Plus it still has to go through validation for automotive use which is an entirely different beast. There's a reason automotive manufacturers are never in cutting-edge nodes. Isn?셳 Tesla?셲 vehicle chip demand a drop in the water compared to Apple? Apple makes ~1 Billion devices per year. Tesla makes ~1 Million cars per year. Tesla is a rounding error. Well, the N3B node that Apple is on rn is very much comparatively experimental, with the N3E that everyone including Apple will be on next year, being cheaper, and performing better. I doubt Tesla will ever need to be on the latest node tho, considering even Nvidia is never on the latest. AMD Frame generation mod by (nukem) just brought my RTX 2060 back to life. 1440p with DLSS balanced custom settings. With these setting I was originally getting 35fps but with the AMD frame gen mod i almost doubled my fps in AW2. It???so big brain. Undercuts nvidia???sales by keeping people who want to stick with nvidia happy with their current hardware This mod really is great. I recently discovered it and can now comfortably play Cyberpunk 2077 at 1440p with a consistent 100+ fps on my RTX 2070 Super. I'd like to know what other people's experience have been? Mine has been pretty good so far and the input delay isn't bad I can't really tell tbh. link to mod ONLY TRY THIS IN SINGLE PLAYER GAMES!! https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/738?tab=files random tutorial i followed to get it working https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZoia9jd7mo&t=1s i subscribed to him because it worked :) he also has recent video for the AW2 ghosting glitch. Incase anyone Is wondering about latency when im enableding this Framegen mod my (Video render latency) was going up by 30-40ms. Not bad when 45fps native is giving me 95ms render latency. It goes to 120ms with FG ON  I was complaining about how my 3080 won't get frame gen right on the same day this mod was released . It's sooo incredible, I tested on cyberpunk at 2k everything maxed out, path tracing on, I get around 80-90 fps with dlss balanced . Over 100 fps on spiderman remastered again max I got some decent results when I tried it out last week. Alan Wake @ med/low on my 2080ti went from 55-60fps to 95-100fps. Cyberpunk maxed out went from 30fps to 60fps but the smearing was too distracting, playing with RT off bumped me from 60fps to 100fps tho. I'm confused, why would there be an AMD mod to enable frame gen on an nvidia card?  AMD's upscaling and other things are open to run on all cards, but forgot that FSR is AMD's thing . I apparently also wasn't keeping up with FSR news well enough because I had no idea there was FSR frame gen now . Because AMD aren't dicks. I tried the mod but got really weird ghosting around the character. Can't Claim Txn 2.1.1 Windows Chia GUI - Trying to claim a clawback txn (using fee 0.00001 XCH) that I received and getting error ""No transaction ids returned"" I sent a txn from one wallet of mine (Chia GUI) to another (Chia GUI) with a one hour clawback. Originally it told me the fee was too low to be included in the mempool but a minute later it seemed to have sent. It showed up in the recipient wallet but after the 1 hour clawback period I cannot claim it. I would be happy to either claim the txn or cancel back to the sending wallet. Any tips on how to resolve? TIA So I was able to somehow push a claim through by ""Delete Unconfirmed Transactions"" OK, got it to work. Delete Unconfirmed Txn's Shut down Chia Delete Wallet DB Restart Chia and let wallet sync Claim w/ 0.00001 fee I checked it 48 hours later and the claim worked. This is likely all a symptom of the Blockchain being busy currently. Cancel On-chain TXN with LND. I need to Double-spend and unconfirmed UTXO. I need to double spend on LND and I dont know how to do it. Long story short, I screwed up twice in a row trying to pay an invoice. I scanned the on-chain bitcoin address instead of the LN invoice. I did this twice. I know I know, I should have been careful, but it's only like $30 total, so not a crazy amount.  The fee was auto set at 2 sats per byte and broadcasted . I need to re-spend these UTXOs with a higher fee to an address I control . The existing addresses are to an expired invoice to a company . I can't wait it out and ask them for a refund because that could be months from now . Hmm I did something like this with psbt. My case was that I?셝 used 1 sat/byte to open a channel and realized this was a mistake - I was able to construct a psbt then finalize then broadcast https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/lnd/psbt This seems like a promising path. When i try to select the UTXOs with manual coin selection, the listunspent"" command only shows the unconfirmed outgoing UTXOs. Do you have any idea on how to select the UTXOs before they were included in the unconfirmed transaction?"" Thanks for the help! Can you ssh into your node? yes. I have full control of my node, but can't find a way to construct a new txn with the UTXOs before they were put into this low fee txn. I've researched the lncli wallet bumpfee command. But that only seems to bump fees to the existing address in the txn. i need to ""double spend"" to new addresses. TSMC charts a course to trillion-transistor chips, eyes 1nm monolithic chips with 200 billion transistors The cost for 1nm could be insanely high for now, but with investment and passing of tine the cost will descend significantly and we could see this rise of these chips in everyday computing. Don?셳 let the doomsday believes bring you down, future is on an exciting path. This will be huge for neuromorphic chipsets and connectome mapping. From 2025 to 2030 a 2x in transistors? Holy cow Moores law slowed down a lot. It's not the only thing that can increase compute. Node names have had only marginal association with actual feature sizes for at least a decade. And yet foundries and designers still finds ways to squeeze more and better compute out of a given amount of silicon. We are starting to hit some hard limits of how small a transistor can get. 1nm is already reaching atomic scale. We have to scale compute by means other than making smaller transistors. I wouldn't worry about Moores Law, we probs just near the top of S curve for the current technology and probs at the very bottom of one of the superseding technologies that will eventually replace it. Will these chips eventually be put into smartphones?  Server Tech to Smartphone always needs 7-8 years . Server Tech gets smaller-- now you get it for PC and same cycle--- than Laptop --- than Smartphone and TV . Server -- Lower Price for Server-- Performance for the same Price . I heard the whole '6nm 5nm 4nm etc.' thing is just marketing and doesn't correspond to what's happening physically anymore. I wonder what they will go with after 1nm? Not like you can have 0nm chips. Glad to know that I will play 3ds emulators at full speed in 2030 At what point is it no longer financially feasible to develop current chip fabrication further versus attempting to scale and integrate other computing technologies, such as quantum is this good news?, im too busy to read the full article. Hardly likely. They have the backing of the majority of the developed world. They'll get pumped with whatever cash they need for however long it takes. Bad take They will likely be leaning on 3d scaling to make up any shortfalls in performance (if they have to scale back performance targets). Which means energy efficiency becomes increasingly important, as dissipating heat from a stacked chip will be one of the most significant limiting factors. No",0

adjustments Opinions on AMD Hey guys Wanted to get some more experienced peoples opinions I dont know if this kind of post is allowed or not If not I apologize and feel free to remove So Im a pc gamer and have noticed AMD has been popping off in all aspects Almost nothing bad has been said about them this generation and I have heard and seen a lot of people moving from Intel and nvidia to AMD I bought some calls on it since I believe it to continue to go up These are my current options its not much but Im a beginner And before anyone says it I know people recommend to not do options early on and I understand why Im not afraid of losing the little bit of money I have in there My goal is to get some decent chunks of change from AMDs calls and reinvest the profits into actual shares and using the original investment into calls again Here are my options The first 3 are cheap yolos that I know have a small chance The second 2 are the ones I care about and really hoping does well I feel like I made pretty decent choices Opinions I have a sizable position in AMD built up over the past few years and I am very bullish on the companylong term prospects That having been said you going to get absolutely wrecked on these options Buy more in 2024 on pullbacks AMD Everybody forgets this every goddamn time but semis are cyclical Just look at where semiconductors were a year ago You need to ask yourself ere in the cycle are we nowNOT y is this time different Astute observation Where are we in the cycle The gaming market is much less relevant than the data center when discussing AMD NVIDIA and Intel as investments AMD is a distant second to NVIDIA in the data center but is ahead of Intel But tbh AMD is pretty expensive right now 45 times earnings with slower growth than NVIDIA at 25 times earnings I am balls deep AMD and have been for the last few years no educated opinion but came looking to see if anyone is talking about AMD its skyrocketed and I barely read and hear about it top performer for me Built a PC with an AMD CPU and GPU and have been happy with the products so I added some stock to my portfolio Im a simple person AMD and NVidia are literally the only companies able to produce chips for training of AI It makes no sense to claim both are overpriced AI is going to be here for many years to come Outside of the Magnificent 7 the rest of the SP 500 did nothing Im going to eat my own eyeballs if I read this one more time Heres a list of all the SP 500 companies that are up this year Apples an amazing business but there are 60 stocks that have done

Srsly SP 500 is almost 25 this year and no trying to divine which stock will be the breakout hit of the year before it happens What more do you want M7 70 SP 493 6 Thats why What if you take out the worst 7 who cares  did the spy go up yes so what are you complaining about Youre freaking out about something that was pretty much completely true a month ago At one point this year they had rallied and nothing else had Over 90 of the gains of the index came from those 7 companies It might be slightly less true now than it was a month ago but youre raging about something thats not even wrong My favorite are the Perfect 3 The Nasdaq the SP and the Dow Jones They always go up and never go down over time The bottom feeders just get replaced anyway SPs perceived success in the market is largely inflated by unsustainable wildly outlier stocks in 7 companies as perceived elite returns When you adjust for the future by bringing down the outlier stocks it regresses heavily to a slightly above average return For those out of the loop People point out the magnificent 7 not just because they are the best performing stocks but because they are extremely large and have also performed very well therefore increasing their contribution to the SP return 2024 setting up to be a return to the mean year meaning it would be wise to buy the breadth Large Value The top two are part of the 7sooooo which ones have done better Am I missing something Look at affirm and Carvana Well duh this is kinda exactly why index funds are an amazing invention Good luck trying to figure out what the very few winning stocks are going to be every year It entirely conceivable and even likely to build your own portfolio of 3050 individual stocks and still have crappy returns because your selection didn catch the 12 outized winners Even if wise many did better they represent a tiny fraction of the SP500 The M7 is 30 of the index so what happens to them significantly influences what happens to the index itself Also NVIDIA and meta the two highest gainers are part of the M7 About 145 did better than the overall average 45 are better than Apple Playing around During the day after hours
It dropped close to 30 several times whats the deal with it going up TSMC aims for nextgen 1nmclass monolithic chips with 1 trillion transistors by 2030 There is a new material to make maybe gallium nitride Yeah but 11 trillion in 2031 so we should wait another year before upgradingS Its kind of crazy that just 15 years ago Anand Lal of Anandtech was in awe over 14 Bn transistors on the GT200  576 mmsq that powered the humongous GTX280 with a phat 512bit bus But then again the 8800GTX is almost old enough to have its driving license so I guess Im just getting old The best time to upgrade is always next year What if 1 trillion transistors opens a gateway to another dimension and the monsters attack All is fair in generating value for shareholders new isekai y little trillion transistors to a monster dimension can be this cuteTSMC I dont think the author understands what monolithic means The TSMC roadmap screenshot in the article clearly shows a chiplet with 1 Tr transistors I thought 3 nm X ray lithography was the resolution limit How on earth are they going to get consistent 1 nm resolution The Asionometry on YouTube can answer this question 1nm isnt the actual size of the transistors silicon is 02nm and there isnt any way to get a transistor to be 5 atoms in size AFAIK  they just keep the naming scheme of smaller  better since thats how it was until around 4528nm when planar scaling stopped Transistors largely havent shrunken significantly since then but they still have gotten a bit smaller and mainly packed a lot denser with other power and speed optimizations too so the performance and density have keep growing Doesnt that mean their defect rate needs to be less than 11000000000000 one in a trillion You design around parts of your fab will not work The 4090 had an unprecedentedly high unused transistor percentage of 12 Why How does that maths work Why cant you design redundancy Why cant you fuse off some defects How does your definition compare to the D0 in the real world We are really pushing the boundaries of physics Hopefully by then the US will have a fab in North America so we dont need to reply on TW anymore",4

2024-01-02,"Beijing criticises Netherlands' move to block ASML exports to China Then maybe China shouldnt treat stealing IP as a national sport Beijing should be happy about it, since according to Chinese government, more embargoes make them stronger and able to develop more advanced technology. So Beijing should be thanking Netherlands for helping them achieve this instead of criticizing. This isn't at all surprisng from what I remember the Netherlands had already scaled back their export of these machines to China. So this is just to curb China's efforts to reach basic levels of chip production even though their current chip production is the equivelant to whats in an Iphone 7. Previous News: ASML shares dip after Netherlands pulls licence for some China exports (January 2, 2024) Of course that Wall Street doesn't like, it, WS just cares about how much more money can a company make, not how ethically or if we're selling equipment to a country to build weapons that they will point at us. China on Tuesday urged the Netherlands to ""respect market principles"" If only China follows their own advice It's hilarious when the CCP themselves are THE champions of protectionist policies and strive for a mercantilist approach, yet decry when other players act accordingly when the CCP doesn't honor any single economic pact or agreement then enter in. This is bigger news than people know You do something right when criticized by China :) Its the first market of the new year now Son its not good to see you like this",-2

(Gifted NYT article) One of the leading microchip and semiconductor manufacturers in the springs laid off nearly 40 people before the holidays. I'm curious if this will create long term employment for residents or if it will be another quick hire before seasonal lay offs typical for the industry. May I ask who are the main leading manufacturers in the springs? That?셲 a lot of money to invest in legacy chips that aren?셳 being designed into new products. It's all part of the effort to move chip production back to the US. Chip production doesn't have to always be bleeding edge. So much of our devices uses decade old chips to make them run, yet without the production (as shown back in 2021), so many of our everyday devices becomes impossible to manufacture. This money isn't going towards making sure you can get your iPhone if TSMC gets absorbed by China. It's to make sure you can still make your coffee in the morning. Apparently too stupid too... This isn't 1987 lol, nobody in the world has small enough hands to physically make the chips used today. Even using a microscope is too crude. Chips have been made with laser etching for years. Is this the big announcement today?",-2

2024-01-05,Our kid is in adolescence thats why Emotional ups and downs are intense Itll get better in a few years right People who switched from AMD and why To the people who switched from amd has there been a difference in game stuttering or any type of stutter at all or atleast less compaired to amd Im on amd but recently ive been getting nothing but stutters and occasional crashes Have you experienced more stability with intel From what ive researched is that intel is more stable in terms of having any issue with system errors and stuff like that Although amd does get better performance i woud gladly sacrifice performance over stability and no stutters any day What has been your exprience from switching i just get what ever is a good deal bro you cant just go around chadding like that Exactly And I usually park on a platform for a while just for the economy of scale Having a few PCs with the same platform is useful for troubleshooting and switching parts around All that to say that Ive been on an older Intel platform before switching to AM4 both for gaming and for my servers TrueNAS mostly and both have been great so far I havent switched over from AMD but the biggest advantage I think Intel has in desktops is memory stability Just timing really I was building a new rig and the 7000 series x3d chips were still months away I had USB and stutteringframe drop issues with my 5800x CPU so that was also a motivator to switch to Intel I have been happy so far I needed to heat my basement while gaming Truly a multipurpose machine I used both pretty equally over the years going back to the Athlon XP and Pentium days so itnever been about picking a amor anything It shifts back and forth gentogen In my experience though I generally found Intel does better with 1 lows single threaded apps and exhibits less stutter AMD provides a snappier desktop experience and better multithreaded performance That said I wouldnnecessarily assume stutter is just due to using AMD not would I assume Intel is immune to stutter A lot of factors impact stutter latency and speed When I switched AMD had big idle and low load power consumption Idle and low power consumptuon is something you will never see on YouTube reviews They only show maximum power I built a PC with a Ryzen 5 1600 back in 2018 the motherboard died last year and I didnt have much money so it was cheaper to get a 13400f and keep my RAM instead of going AM5 Its able to run everything I throw at it without a sweat on a cheap air cooler The bull market is over Nasdaq is back to 11000 hours,0

Hot take: Cramer has been plugging NVDA non stop since 2018 and hasn?셳 been incorrect in a single statement about it. Damn it i just brought calls. In a truly regarded move, at the next fed meeting JPow unleashes his ultimate weapon. Standing firm like an oak tree, JPow ushers ""my good friend"" Jim Cramer to the podium, serendipitously gesturing to the mic. As the press stares in a hushed silence, JPow slowly asks ""What are your thoughts on the economy, Jim?"" Cramer leans forward and bows his head, eyes closed. Everyone feels the gravity of the moment. With a stern resolve, Cramer raises his eyes to the cameras. He speaks: ""We're fucked. It's over. Recession confirmed."" JPow smiles. ""Thank you, Jim."" Cramer turns to Powell with an acknowledging nod. The U.S. embarks on a decade of prosperity unrivaled in its history. Jpow retires, authoring his magnum dong opus: Inverse Cramer.

Europe at last has an answer to Silicon Valley ASML a mighty Dutch tech firm is at the heart of it At last ASML was founded in 1984 I really don get this post Are people finding out about ASML today It why we have computers Not from 2020 2019 etc onwards But for decades already They needed a clickbait title not one that was correct So the answer to the lack of dynamic startup creation is a niche industry with little to no competition revolving around a single established player Yeah that sound like the European way There technically is a competition For nontraditional steppers there is the Canon with their nanoimprint technology which does not require the EUV source that makes the ASML machines so complex And while the steppers are sold by ASML the whole endeavor has been a joined project by multiple companies that took over a decade to develop with at least the German companies Zeiss and Trumpf and surely others sourcing the EUV optics and radiation source respectively We don see a lot of companies in that space because it takes insane amounts of work risk and money to remain competitive US and Chinese companies buy pretty much all slightly successful startups so nothing stays in Europe ASML has been operating in the Netherlands for decades China cant afford it China is a factory not a research lab theyre not innovating much Thats why theyre completely reliant on European machinery to produce all electronics Trust reurope to bring out the whisky and gun for a vaguely positive article No ASML is nothing new but the impetus for the article appears to be 1 their sustained value growth in recent years 2 the Mittelstandesque array of suppliers which have popped up in Europe to support ASML bringing expertise to the old continent Having players in the industry at the absolute top of their game is no bad thing and can help spawn off bigger and better things And the moaning about them being niche and a monopolywhat Sure it niche in a sense it also just about the most critical source of machinery to be found anywhere and therefore hardly niche at all And if theye a monopoly it only because theye the very best at what they do  and theye doing it right here in Europe Honestly I wonder if this subreddit is just Chinese bots sometimes We had that nswerfor a while Like the outwardly unassuming machine its Dutch maker is full of surprises The company market value has quadrupled in the past five years to 60bn 285bn making it Europe most valuable technology firm see chart 1 Between 2012 and 2022 its revenues and net income both rose roughly fourfold to 1bn and bn respectively At the end of 2023 asml operating margin exceeded 34 staggering for a hardware business and more than that of Apple the world biggest maker of consumer electronics see chart 2 Such stellar performance which is likely to shine even more brightly when asml reports quarterly results on January 24th is now routine The firm holds a monopoly on a key link in the world most critical supply chain without its kit it is next to impossible to make cuttingedge computer processors such as those that go into smartphones and data centres where artificial intelligence ai is trained With global semiconductor sales forecast to double to 13trn by 2032 every big country and every big chipmaker wants asml gear The company has become so important in the SinoAmerican techtussle that as it emerged at the start of the year President Joe Biden administration pressed asml to cancel planned deliveries of even its older machines to China Yet asml spectacular success is also underpinned by two other less obvious factors The company has created a network of suppliers and technology partners that may be the closest thing Europe has to Silicon Valley And its business model ingeniously combines hardware with software and data These unsung elements of asml success challenge the notion that the old continent is incapable of developing a successful digital platform asml complex machines perform a simple task They project the blueprints of computer chips onto photosensitive silicon wafers In 1986 when its first model was delivered individual transistors measured micrometres and the company kit was almost like a glorified photocopier explains Marc Hijink a Dutch journalist and author of ocusow asml Conquered the Chip World a new book Today with transistors shrunk by a factor of a thousand asml lithography gear is possibly the most sophisticated equipment ever sold commercially asml and its partners pulled off this incredible shrinking trick with engineering that has a sciencefiction ring to it The process starts with powerful lasers incinerating droplets of molten tin each no thicker than a fifth of a human hair and travelling at more than 250km per hour This produces extremely shortwavelength light extreme ultraviolet or euv in the jargon which is then reflected by a set of mirrors so smooth that the biggest imperfection is no bigger than the distance grass can grow in a millisecond To make all this worth a chipmaker whilehe latest model costs more than 300mnd expose enough chips the object that holds the wafer called a able has to accelerate faster than a rocket and come to a stop at exactly the right spot To get an idea of what it takes to build such a device pay a visit to a nondescript factory in Neuklln a neighbourhood of Berlin This is where asml makes among other things irror blocks the main part of a wafer table These are sturdy pieces of a special ceramic material a square 8cm thick and measuring about 50cm on each side Some get polished measured repolished remeasured and so on for nearly a yearntil they are exactly the right shape including allowances for the fact that they will sag a few nanometers once installed The factory is emblematic of the company unusual network of suppliers Although its owner Berliner Glas was acquired by asml in 2020 it lives halfway between being an independent company and a unit of the Dutch parent Something similar is true of the 800 or so mostly European firms that help put together asml machines asml only owns stakes in a few of them Yet their interdependence makes them act like a single organisation asml outsources over 90 of what it costs to build one of its engineering marvels and directly employs fewer than half the estimated 100000 people the feat requires This is partly owing to history When the company was spun out of Philips a Dutch electronics giant in 1984 asml seemed stillborn Its idea to build a ilicon stepper the original name of the chipcopying machine was promising But it had not much else going for it in particular no production lines It instead relied on specialist suppliers many of them also former Philips units such as vdl a contract manufacturer Outsourcing is also a function of technology The different parts of a lithography machine are so cuttingedge that doing it all could easily overwhelm any single company ou have to decide where you add the most value and let others do the restexplains a former asml insider Semiconductor economics likewise favours not doing everything yourself The chip industry is prone to booms and busts because demand moves up and down much more quickly than manufacturers can install capacity Prices rise and fall as shortages turn to gluts Makers of chipmaking gear are exposed to the same cycles That makes keeping all the assets inhouse risky better to transfer some of that risk on to suppliers who can in turn limit it by catering to customers who work to different business cycles The required hyperspecialisation prevents the riskreducing double sourcing that is prevalent in many other industries In the case of asml technical demands are so high and production volumes so low it shipped 317 machines in 2022 that it would be uneconomical to manage several suppliers for a single part even if they could be found For such crucial components as lasers and mirrors which are made by Trumpf and Zeiss two German firms respectively it is impossible Wayne Allan who is in charge of sourcing on asml board talks of odependency The upshot is that asml mostly limits itself to being the system architect It decides who does what defines the interfaces between the key parts of its machines which it calls odules and carries out research and development This setup makes it easier to test the pieces and transport the machines shipping the latest model to Intel involved 250 crates and 13 containers It also gives suppliers more freedom including to experiment with novel technologies It all works because asml has cultivated a culture of trust and transparency while preserving elements of competition Suppliers are not squeezed to the last penny Quite the opposite e need them to stay healthysays Mr Allan Information flows freely throughout the network particularly between asml Trumpf and Zeiss Engineering teams from different firms work together patents are shared as is some financial data and sometimes profits t meetings you can tell who is from which firmreports a former Zeiss executive At the same time many suppliers compete with each other indirectly for instance providing similar parts for different generations of asml machines If a supplier runs into trouble asml dispatches a rapid intervention force sometimes even if such help is not welcome As a last resort asml can buy a supplier as was the case with Berliner Glas It is this loosely coupled structure that allowed asml to outcompete its more vertically integrated rivals reckons Willy Shih of Harvard Business School Nikon and Canon two Japanese firms which once led the market for lithography machines never managed to commercialise the more complex euv kit Canon is trying to stage a return with anoimprintlithography which physically stamps chip designs onto wafers asml is now entrenching this dominance by complementing its hardware with software and data When real rockets take off their trajectory is wobbly and needs to be smoothed out by a guidance computer which collects data to predict and adapt their course A wafer table in a lithography machine is similarly likely to miss the mark at first The same is true of the rest of the device It is only with the help of lots of data and machinelearning a type of ai that they can be finetunednd made more accurate This is rapidly turning asml into an ai platform Once Intel has received all the modules for its new machine it will take about two weeks to put the thing together Adapting it to its new location will take several months Bits may have moved in transport gravity may be slightly different in Oregon from in Veldhoven and other machines nearby may create interference Tests will collect reams of data and trigger adjustments e have thousands of knobs we can turn to put it into a perfect statesays Jos Benschop another asml board member Then there is geopolitics asml share price dipped after news broke about the cancelled deliveries to China The worry is less over lower sales asml cannot build its machines fast enough anyway Of greater concern is the risk that strict export controls could in time push China to build its own chipmakinggear industry That could one day threaten asml position at the centre of the industry For the time being though the company network and its network effects remain indomitable Who said Europe couldn do tech Having an answer hm what was the question again How will the EU compete in this global economy while China and the BRICS countries continue growing very rapidly How do we become independent How are we going to stand on our own feet when Trump comes to power The heart and the only one Its is also reliant on American owned tech They could just revoke the licence if they want You guys need something different self reliance is very important Silicon Valley its just a fluke An extremely successful coincidence of factors where the most important thing was not so much location government orders and so on time of its creation If ANYONE in Europe will be able to buy patents as goods in an online store this would solve one of the main problems of all inventions  incomprehension of what exactly technologies and commercial modules could be used in prototypes and subsequent commercial products and which ones are not To create competitive tech firms

Honestly thought it would take more time than this .. started to buy calls this morning. A guy I went to high school with who took down all his social media accounts a few years ago, came back to instagram as a ?쐃quity trader??with a whole new persona of fake money nonsense.

Thought you were better than this amd Its gonna be normal to see stupid shit like this to upsell unfortunately I dont even blame consumers anymore theres just too many things us consumers have to do our own research on up to the point its a full time job tack on we spend quite a bit on parts alone there should be some transparency What is this all about I recently bought a 6750 XT They made a 7600 xt thats exactly the same as the 7600 but with 16 gb vram Thatbetter This is their 4060 Ti 16GB Why are people shocked that AMD would do the same stupid shit that Nvidia did with the 4060 Ti If anything itjust corporations being corporations they do anything for an extra buck I mean its got a bit higher clocks that justifies the 20 msrp increase right right amd decided to hop on 4060 ti 16gb vram bus too lol There isnt a better they are a company thats goal is to make money full stop Daily reminder that companies arent your friends and that if AMD was in NVIDIAs position for GPU market share leader theyd be doing the same The only reason they release stuff as a better value is out of necessity If you cant compete on features give a better value up until you find a niche and then capitalize on it Every company does this All publicly traded companies only exist to funnel money to shareholders",10

Glad I didn't keep my short position till now. I sold nvda at 270 and AMD at 80, as well as Alphabet before the tech rally. All in all pretty cheap reminder that I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing and I should just stick to ETF's. The Everything Money youtubers causing drama in their family due to apparently losing $5million of their extended families money on nvidia shorts is just plain funny right now.  In fact i have zero sympathy for any n Nvidia short seller . I and others have been telling everyone for a year now ""Nvidia will 10x earnings since the AI accelerators have over 100x the margins of their gaming cards""  The average price target is $660 and do you know how many firms say n Nvidia is overvalued and in the sell range right now? Zero . Today n Nvidia's forward PE is better than Apples. They have 8% quarterly growth and if you put that together you can plot a PEG <1 which makes them on the cheap side I mean they literally more than 12x'd YoY earnings in their last report as predicted. You know what didn't 12x YoY for nvidia? Their stock price. It only 3x'd. Unless you think competition will emerge out of nowhere it's actually cheap. Yeah. Nvidia destroyed me. It just keeps going up. Every time I see a shitty AI generated picture, I throw up in my mouth a little. Meta is ripping shorts faces off today What does Chick-fil-A have to do with options? Green line go up I don't think you understand, analysis is to make yourself feel better AFTER you buy a risky option with less than a week till expiration TSMC posts flat Q4 revenue but beats expectations  Taiwan chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) reported a largely flat fourth-quarter revenue . Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T$625.5 billion ($20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations . That beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of between $18.8-19.6 billion, and also beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of T$617.1 billion drawn from 21 analysts. Source: https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmcs-december-sales-down-84-yy-2024-01-10/ I just don't understand TSM. They have HUGE customers in the post GPU and pre AI boom, NVDA and AMD are at ATH, and yet TSM lays flat. they make chips for lots of companies. Many chips are in a downcycle, AI-specific ones are not. Add in also the TPUs for Google. I totally agree. I do not get it. There is a ton of capacity for AI inference that is needed and TSM is where most of it comes from. I think it's because they're a Taiwanese company so not getting as much media exposure as their US based customers (Apple, Nvidia, etc). But as these grow so will TSM. Why do you think USA outsourced manufacturing? Even AMD sold off their foundry. Intel complete chain not doing them any favours. If it?셲 any consolation, the CEOs of both AMD & NVDA are of Taiwanese descent. Why do so many copy all this stuff, we don't need to read it when it's already out there ?쁻 easy karma to be fair, for me, this is the first time i've read it Minimum character count in posts. It has Geopolitical risks As long as people want that RTX 4090 and AI girlfriends, I feel like chips will always be in demand Uh??actually the opposite. Uptrend for mobile, memory, PCs, and AI still in an acute shortage. Auto going through some big shit now. Networking near trough and industrial probably has downside. Weren't those oversupplied chips memory chips? It's still crazy out there, though not as bad as the last couple years. I was going to use a specific ethernet tvs diode the other day, there were 20k available at digikey and today they were all gone.

Um Sell at 150 should I wait a little longer Seems like another need for patience  Held for 2 years sold at 135 with 10 profit then liquidated Nvidia at 350 thought my heart was going to explode remembered it again at 137 feeling good until now lets aim for 200 haha Held at 130 thinking of selling at 140 but it feels like its going to break the alltime high
If it becomes like Nvidia it feels like its going to be really thrilling haha Was planning to sell at 130 but looks like it will reach 150 so hold a bit more Sold all Nvidia at 380 and felt bitter haha You know your economy isn?셳 doing so good when you include TSMC as your no.1 company by capitalisation. Hah, they need to declare Taiwan on their taxes. Taiwan #1 From r/taiwan The Chinese government released their yearly ""Top 20 Market Values of Chinese Companies"", and listed Taiwan's TSMC as their most profitable company Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/s/MZrzosQNe6 So we can start calling the mainland ""west Taiwan"" finally  China included TSMC at the height of that year's Taiwan straits tension to show Tencent and BABA above it . A double power move ""you are part of us whether you agree or not"" and ""your most profitable company is still beneath us"" Back then ,ost Chinese barely cared about it except for the brainless nationalist, but now it's extra ironic especially with current domestic economic situation, even their own citizens made fun of the list and implied government is delusional. Guy who made the list had two choices: (1) include TSMC, or (2) prison for life. He has no regrets. The Chinese copium about Taiwan is very funny. My wife is Taiwanese. I texted her this picture and immediately heard her scream bullshit in the kitchen. Shit, I get it now. China is listing TSMC as its #1 company. Damn that?셲 low??and potentially foreshadowing. Taiwan #1 ..and free Tibet btw Xi seems to be repeating past mistakes by undermining what has led to China's economic success. Hu Jintao, his predecessor, was more progressive and market oriented. All Xi had to do was do nothing and the Chinese economy would be much better today Might as well include Tesla You know the country is fcked up when: Your top 1 company is a company that the government has no real influence on. Top 2 is a gaming company who got rich through rip-offs. Top 3- Alcohol. You mean 1. Apple 2. Microsoft 3. Walmart? Jk What does T stand for? Say it out loud. TCHINA China is part of Taiwan so it makes sense If China invades Taiwan and seizes TSMC, they would inadvertently destroy it. Or the US would destroy it, we'd probably air lift their employees by the thousands and burn the factories",4
2024-01-12," It is important to become aware of the depth of the problem, and find out just how deep-rooted it We are at war. Time to wake up and stop fooling around. Plenty of countries out there want to see us and our values on our knees. Also, dear OP, before you show you are more incompetent (and, right now, you are at 'Russian General Staff' for incompetent) ... The key for Ukraine to win is keeping China neutral. Right now, China is not selling boots, 4x4 trucks, body armor, 122mm shells and all the multitude of other stuff you would generally expect Russia to be buying in quantity off China on credit (see also Lend Lease between 1940-1945 and how the EU is supporting Ukraine). If you do really dumb things, this might change. But it's in China's interests to have Russia weak and crippled. Likewise, it's in Turkey's interest to have Russia weak and crippled. If you change stuff so China and Turkey see it in their interest to have Russia win the war, then they might change their actions. And, me, I like Ukraine being sold TB-2s, and China not selling the Russian army boots that keep the wet out, and I'm not inclined to fuck up a good thing. It's not quick, and it's not cheap. But the current strategy works. China is not selling boots, 4x4 trucks, body armor, 122mm shells and all the multitude of other stuff you would generally expect Russia ... but they do? At least non-lethal stuff like body armor and drones. But they also sell stuff to Ukraine. Well. Yes. But how do you propose to stop Russia buying North Korean weapons ? They have significant weapon stockpiles, but the North Korean economy is, on the most generous estimate, about the same size as Oklahoma City. It's pretty irrelevant vs issues like the US halting aid. If you've ever played civilization this is actually scary because today's geopolitics have been going on longer and there's no actual limits outside the laws of nature. CNC machines. For forging, pressing, machining. Kept supplied with spare parts and software updates from Western companies. Can someone enlighten me about German oil plan and Turkey buying stolen coal?  Russia's economy is going to be in massive trouble after Putin gets reelected . Gas sales are basically gone. Oil is down a lot both in volume and price . They can pay for the war using the national wealth fund for a bit . Lets hope Ukraine gets the weapon she needs. Moscow?셲 monthly income from oil exports is greater now than before the invasion of Ukraine, highlighting the failure of measures to curb its war chest. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-12-06/oil-prices-how-russia-punched-an-11-billion-hole-in-west-s-sanctions-regime While they are earning less than in '22, they are still earning more than before the war. They have shit tons of money. In a multipolar world with a global economy it was always obvious that most of the sanctions would at best be very unpleasant for Russia, but it would not impede their capabilites to wage war in Ukraine. The German Council on Foreign Relations already did a study that suggesed that Russia will have fixed their military-industrial complex to the point that they could produce enough to attack other countries than Ukraine again by 2027. THe Western countries know that and they have have until then to get their own military production on par so they can sufficiently supply both Ukraine and NATO. Almost all of the world's uranium is useless, as we use very little of it. And for a vaguely decent price - and by vaguely decent, I mean 'paid more for the ore than for road gravel', a lot more could be sourced. Refining uranium is the expensive bit. Yellowcake is cheap. Russia controls most of the Uranium in the world, as it comes from Uzbekistan using Russian ports for shipping Biggest Uranium deposit by country: 1쨘 Australia, with over 2x the amount in Kazakhstan (the second place). By production, Kazakhstan is the 1st producer, with little over 45%, If you add Uzbekistan and Russia, you go up to 57-58%. Canada and Australia produce little under 20%. So it's not like they control the world supply, they do control some (though directly only a small amount, around 5%). But if the west feels threatened by this, they can easily ramp up production in Australia and outproduce Russia by a lot. you meant Kazakhstan probably, since kazatomprom was hijacked by rosatomprom about 15 years ago",-2

I thought expectation is that Pixel 10s will utilize the new TSMC chips I find peace in long walks. Yea it?셲 a bummer for my timeline. I?셶e been on iPhone for a year and I want off. I was holding out for P9 but??idk might need to try P8. I hate Samsung chips Can't happen soon enough Yes please. Perfect time to upgrade from pixel 7. Yeah I was considering upgrading for the 9 but now I will hold off for the 10 with tsmc chips probably. Will China invade Taiwan to stop Pixel 10? Amen Good, once they have released one or 2 phones with SOC's that have a chance at not being crap it might be less of an issue to spend MSRP on a Pixel. TSMC isn't designing any chips. The Tensor chips rely heavily on Samsungs designs, which are much more the problem than samsungs manufacturing process.  The tensor G4 for the pixel 9 will be another round of samsung design and samsung manufacturing . After that we will go to 3nm TMSC, with a completely new and custom google design, not building on samsung designed exynos foundations . If this will be something similar like apple when they ditched the arm reference Fab CM is one thing, but the overall SoC itself is still a disaster. Based on my battery use, this phone basically uses 2x the drain of an iPhone in standby. Will that get fixed by going to TSMC? Yup. Look at the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 vs the 8+ Gen 1 as an example. Same chip, one made by Samsung, the other TSMC. The 8+ Gen 1 was able to get a lot better efficiency, and with a small clock speed boost Unfortunately this will be for the P10 and not the P9. Imagine a 2024 flagship still stuck on a 3 year old SoC with a disgraceful modem. And I still wouldn't buy the p10, first generation is definitely going to suck, I'll wait for the 2nd gen Google self designed chip Let's hope TMSC factories are still there in the next years... It's no big deal short term imo. The gains will be small at first. The better 5g modem with less energy drain would be good. On medium/long term supplying own chip designs in various gadgets would be interesting, as it would make support for longer term much easier. Google already had been using TSMC for their other chips. They do their TPUs for example. So it was always only a matter of time until they switched FABs. All I really want to know is whether Google will be sticking with Samsung for the modem or not. I've been fine with the performance of the Tensor chips, but modem performance is what I mainly care about right now, and if they still continue to stick with Samsung for that, then cellular performance will probably still be poor.  LFG!!! I thought this was well known... And it's not happening for 2 years (pixel 10) Google reportedly locks down Tensor testing in Taiwan ahead of switch to TSMC  The title almost reads like there was a security breach and Google responded by sealing off Tensor testing . As a minor gripe, ""locks down"" is a strange turn of phrase to use here . It seems like Google sent their Tensor design to KYEC for testing .  The Tensor G5 should be a notable improvement over the G4 . Battery life and cell reception are probably the most common complaints . Both would generally see improvements from the Tensor chip being fabbed by TSMC instead of Samsung . You are right about the wording it's wrong. For the point on radio there wouldn't be much difference if this was a Samsung modem being fabbed by TSMC, it would just be more power efficient so battery life would improve (comparing fab performance right now that is). Samsung Exynos designs haven't been fabbed at TSMC either due to requirements that is it not done there or just a discount agreement with parties such as Google that makes more economic sense to stay all together. So this fifth generation is likely their full custom solution rather than semi custom exynos design which will have even greater scope for change than just moving from Samsung fab to TSMC fabs. I would remain sceptical of this, it's hard to nail good designs first time and Google have a habit of cancelling things. I wouldn't be surprised if the design ended up being worse than the competing Exynos at the time let alone Qualcomm latest interation of snapdragon.  Google had so many issues with pixel 6 generation, it was mostly software and they were pretty dreadful at fixing them . I dread to think how behind it will be when a full custom solution launches but I do hope it actually delivers as more competition is a good thing overall . What makes you think modem would improve based on process? inb4 ""performance gains equate to more cpu idle, and therefore efficiency gains"". Pixel with TSMC will be a huge improvement on thermals, battery ...maybe even processing power (though I don't care about that). Pixel 10 is going to be a winner.  Pixel with TSMC will be a huge improvement on thermals, battery I'm counting on Pixel 10 being a shit show. First-ever full custom SoC is a write-off and it doesn't matter who does it. Even Apple didn't knock it out of the park until 2-3 releases later - you think Google can do it on the first try? Finally I can buy a Pixel phone, their awful battery and thermals are the reason I'm not buying one right now Finally I can buy a Pixel phone, their awful battery and thermals are the reason I'm not buying one right now Let's cut to the chase: you're not getting one. First full custom Tensor in a Pixel isn't something to wishlist for - that thing's a lost cause. Wait for version two instead, because the majority of what ails version 1.0 would be ironed out by then. As for awful battery and thermals, I have neither on mine. I don't even bother with power-saving anymore. Have an 8 pro, since launch, after the first update in December, no more heating and better battery life So the pixel may have a processor that doesn?셳 suck? The Pixel 9 may the first one that?셲 worth buying since the original. EDIT: yeah, I got it, Pixel 10. Can?셳 wait to see how Google cocks that one up. The first Pixel expected to use TSMC is the Pixel 10 nope, this chip (G5) is going into pixel 10. The 9 is using the G4, which is just going to be a minor refresh of the G3. Pixel 9 may in fact suck harder than the Pixel 8, relative to the competition. Everyone else will be moving ahead by another generational leap, whereas Google is only taking a half step forward next year. Pixel 10 So their contact with Samsung has expired and their realized they been cutting the corners too much and ppl are noticing. Good expect a marginal improvement nothing to be excited about. The chips are still going to be 2-3 gens behind Apple and 1-2 gens behind sd Finally. I hope Google will not regret the move in two years in case China starts its expected war with Taiwan. The world urgently needs to diversify chip manufacturers. So it's in our best interest to wish Samsung compete with TSMC If I hadnt immigrated to the US 80 years ago It was Warren Buffett NVDA Director sells shares for a total of $19.69 Million.

2024-01-18,"Amd per Whats going on 1200 times TSMC delays 3nm Arizona fab by a year, cites lack of U.S. subsidies and waning demand There are a LOT of workers available that can work in the fabs in Az. We have so many that have worked for Intel, Microchip, Motorola, ON semiconductor, and a few more. However, paying what they are worth or want IS the sticking point for TSMC. Importing low wage workers is always in mind. Probably the old ?쁢ntry level paying job requiring 10 years of experience??tactic. That way they can say they tried before ringing the H-1B registers. I applied, wanted to know my high school GPA, didn?셳 care about my experience. Never got a call back. Yup, I declined a role with TSMC in (was it buckeye?) Because they offered me below market rate for my role. At the time they were offering ~$20/hr for a helpdesk role. At the time I was making 27/hr for a rival semiconductor company. Shame. I was interested in working there but not for a paycut. Honestly this is on TSMC. Phoenix has a good infrastructure for semiconductor manufacturing. They couldn?셳 figure it out and it?셲 on them. Intel, Microchip, and OnSemi figured it out. Remember when they dissed local workers saying they weren?셳 skilled enough? Then backtracked soon after? They?셱e hiring process and pay is way too complicated and low to drive all the way the fuck out there in North Phoenix for work. Don?셳 forget NXP Doesn?셳 help that local officials are tussling with TSMC since TSMC wants to import their own workers instead of hiring locally. A lot of things need sorting out before this benefits the community. I'm fine with TSMC coming to my area. I'm fine with them bringing in experts from their corporate structure... but hire the local help. I don't care if they don't exist, as well. If we don't benefit from it, I don't want tax money helping. The trouble is they're paying the same kind of money one could get at In-N-Out Burger or Chick-fil-A. But they expect people to kill themselves working insane hours like their asian employees. And after requiring six months of training abroad too. Is this the beginning of the end? Bets on this going tits-up like Foxconn in Wisconsin? Most likely. I don?셳 believe for a second TSMC ever had intentions of holding up their end of the deal with hiring locals. Lack of subsidies. The US military underwrites your entire country lol. Your market cap is $500 billion. Build your plant with your own money it's not my job to pay for your shit. This plant is a scam just like Foxconn's AI 8K+5G empty warehouse in Wisconsin. I see it about 3-5x a week and if it's a scam, there are probably 5,000 people working there night and day who would notice it was a giant scam. Go to Lake Pleasant and you?셪l see a bizarre village of haphazardly-parked travel trailers. I presume the inhabitants of this dystopia are constructing the facility. The Arizona project is a complete dumpster fire, so I glad I moved on from that place. Sounds like a victory if they just get that first fab up and running. But I wonder what what?셲 holding back the Chips Act incentives. Applied there for a Semiconductor Technician. $19hr. Nope. TSMC predicts delays, less advanced chips at second Arizona fab TSMC's US fab has been a trainwreck so far. This was always going to go through because A - it was a rare double victory for the US government to look like they're taking steps to ensure chip supply AND send a message to Beijing that their saber-rattling doesn't scare us, and B, free money for TSMC. That said, TSMC-AZ was never going to be the technology leader, and I don't see how anyone expected anything otherwise. Any sane person could see that the different environmental and employment regulations would require substantial changes to how TSMC works. maybe by design, why would taiwan want to give up its largest geopolitical leverage Meanwhile the new Samsung fab in Texas should be online by EoY It will be interesting to see who gets TSMC N3 up and running first, Arizona or Japan. Arizona was supposed to arrive much earlier but it might actually be close, tho it is worth noting that TSMC Japan's 3nm plans are so preliminary that rumors aren't even sure what state it's gonna be built in (Osaka? Kumamoto? Kanagawa/Yokohama?). Japan isnt even slated to get a 3nm fab, its just rumors so far, and thus would put any fab like 4 years out. I wouldn?셳 be surprised if TSMC scraps the Arizona fab since by the time it is built, N3 might not have the volume to support the overhead Foxconn Wisconsin vibes tingling.

They give it a D - underperform rating. You'll have to read any research they publish about it to know their reasons, but my gut is saying: the stock is up 15% in a month and has tripled in the last year it has a p/e of 75 so there are VERY lofty growth expectations 52 week range is $170 to $580 so it's very volatile NVDA is well-positioned as a leader in just about everything high tech of the future - high-performance computing, scientific simulation, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, you name it - so the fundamentals look good but from a technical perspective they appear crazily overvalued and overbought given the recent AI hypetrain. You could say the same about Apple or Google in the early 2000s. NVIDA seems like a cash machine now. Their product is pretty much very essential today. What? You mean Schwab won't let me gamble my family's money wildly without any warnings? If you click on the research report, it opens up a PDF report that will detail why it's rated a D and break down all the components of their rating. Did you read it or just look at the overall letter grade? I read it, I think they put a a lot of weight on P/E. I sold my shares at $500 thinking I was smart lol. Boy was I wrong. like most people, they overvalue the overvaluation. I?셝 compare Schwab?셲 reports to the others we have available. They crushed it last year, so expecting the same performance this year as a new investor might leave you disappointed. Even a great company that will grow a ton might be a bad investment if the price is too high. NVDA is a great company and I do think they will grow and continue to dominate for the next 5-10 years. Does that make it a good investment? Even good companies can be over priced. If you click on the Schwab Equity Ratings Report for NVDA they clearly spell out why it has a current D rating. It's an extensive report. I own NVDA and Schwab's rating did not influence my purchase. Why is TSMC so important?  Report on state of world's semiconductor industry in 2022 says that the US already has almost half the world's total semiconductor market share . Most of the US's wafer production capacity is already headquartered and based in the US . So why is so much focus put on TSMC? Is it because it's responsible for disproportionately producing high end chips So why is so much focus put on TSMC? Is it because it's responsible for disproportionately producing high end chips  Yielding yields are significantly better than US chip manufacturing at all generation levels . This makes it dramatically more cost competitive . It's akin to claiming ""Ferrari can make luxury cars"" in tiny numbers, at incredible cost . How important are high end chips to the US defence establishment To some degree the defense industry, but primarily the civilian sector where performance density, power efficiency, etc are crucial. It doesnt take cutting edge processors to guide a missile...even a few generations back is workable so long as the chip survives the more important factors such as g-forces, temperature shifts, shocks, etc. Or are they purely looking at it from an economic standpoint from the impact it will have on the consumer electronics industry(where there's a strong demand for high tech, cutting edge chips).  The Whizbang 9000 missile doesn't need a current gen chip, but manufacturing, ordering, shipping, and tracking most of the component parts does . A rubber chicken is pretty low tech. All the parts of the manufacturing and logistical chain is staggeringly high tech .  TSMC's Taiwan-based chip fabs are so fragile that an invasion would take them offline and kneecap the global economy . Taiwan's government is WELL aware of this, and TSMC keeping their highest end chip Fabs in Taiwan is a matter of national defense referred to as its ""Silicon Shield"" Taiwan's government is WELL aware of this, and TSMC keeping their highest end chip fabs in Taiwan is a matter of national defense referred to as its ""Silicon Shield"".  Asia has become the factory of the world. Everything is made there. Even raw ish materials made in the US are in abundant supply . Shipping TO asia is basically free because of how much is shipped from Asia to the rest of the world and how little is shipped from the rest of the world to Asia. Anyway, the crucial thing is that it's not just the processor dies produced by TSMC fabs that are important, it's the entire supply chain for western electronics. Simply having a processor die is barely more useful than having a handful of sand. This was part of what happened during the covid pandemic... Suddenly almost random parts of the supply chain would fail.  Most businesses were probably operating on ""lean"" manufacturing, meaning that, on the one hand, they don't pay to warehouse stock... on the other hand, ... they literally have no buffer of parts . Suddenly any of a hundred different things suddenly now now has months long lead time . So TSMC builds a fab in Arizona... problem solved, right? Well... no... That's just one part of the supply chain... Literally every other part of the supply chain is still in Asia... And what's going to be happening to the supply chains in Asia if there's a war between China and Taiwan?  TSMC business model is to produce chips for other companies . Company A does the research but lacks the very expensive machinery to make chips on a large scale . TSMC does that for company A, while never interfering with their own ideas .  TSMC holds around 50% of the worlds normal chips, and around 90% of high end chips, followed by South Korea and then the US as third . EU, US and China wants to increase domestic chip production .  In a modern civilian car there are around 1000 chips - in a modern airplane, tank, ship, HIMARS missile or average command centre this number would probably be far higher . Both chips are incredibly important both for the civilian and defense sector . the avionics of even a modern fifth generation jet like the F-35 are more akin to like, a PS2  While the basic electronic systems of the F-25 were developed around 20 years ago, they are upgraded (right now in the Block 3 / 4 version IIRC) and are much improved . Same goes for many other systems and /or upgrades currently or in the near future (F22 Raptor upgrade, F15 EX upgrades, Abrams X, So is the whole TSMC issue just blown up a lot for political reasoning?  A war in that region would impact the future of either the West or the East massively, both economically and military power . Intel cannot produce shiny new i915000k for a modern gaming rig and Mercedes Benz cannot put a shiny new S-class limousine . SYL comparing aircraft avionics to a play station 2... means they have a lot of processing power. Gaming consoles are mass-market computers with typically impressive computational performance per cost. And that makes sense, there is a lot of math going on in radars.  TSMC is important because they make the bleeding edge of chips . Intel, Micron, and Samsung all also make high tech chips, but TSMC currently holds the performance crown .  The countries with the most powerful compute hardware have a massive upper hand in geopolitics . Taiwan themselves know this, and have not allowed TSMC* to offshore their most complex fabs . So it is then up to the US to defend Taiwan, to make sure that TSMC will stay open . *TSMC is basically owned by the ROC government. They are the largest shareholder. Yeah, TSMC can do EUV lithography (a very tricky technology, once you dive into the details, you are seriously baffled as to how this can even work in practice) on a large scale, and has the combined know-how and management to consistently stay at the forefront of global R&D. Too many American corporations have been MBA-ed into irrelevance. Pushing the limits of engineering requires a very different mindset and investment patterns from delivering regular dividends to shareholders every quarter. https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-hires-over-100-TSMC-engineers-in-push-for-chip-leadership i don't think that forced reunification is necessary for chinese electrical engineering firms to get TSMC techs You once had integrated companies like IBM, Motorola, Intel, AMD,TI who designed the chips and then manufactured them in their own fabs. Intel which was once a thought and market leader in semi-conductors is struggling to get their act together. AMD, Motorola and IBM at one time had massive chip manufacturing capabilities have spun off chip manufacturing.  Nividia, whose graphic chips (GPU's) are very important to visualization and displays and for this they are better than Intel x architecture and vital for defense applications . Qualcomm, whose chips are used in most mobile phones has them manufactured at TSMC or Samsung . Apple which initially used Motorola manufactured microprocessors, then moved to IBM and then Intel products now has their own Apple Silicon. These are Apple designed chips using ARM (another fabless company) architecture and manufactured by TSMC. Amazon and Google now have their own semi-conductors they put into their products again manufactured by TSMC and others.  Both Samsung and TSMC are well within the China strike zone . US does not even manufacture some of the high end chips needed, only designs them . The CPU, the GPU, Memory chips (RAM, NAND), SOC, are all required . ""U.S. semiconductor firms have maintained their competitive edge in microprocessors and other leading-edge devices, as well as having continued to lead in a range of other product areas. In addition, U.S. semiconductor firms maintain a leading position in R&D, design, and process technology"" Well... That's baloney.  US firms are doing great at design, but TSMC is simply ahead on process technology . Anything that says otherwise is spin. That can change in a few years if Intel catches up . Nvidia used to use other fabs like IBM and UMC to manufacture their GPU's. Today they depend on TSMC for all of their high end production. AMD used to fab their own processors. Today they depend on TSMC. In the 90's, Apple used processors manufactured by Motorola, IBM, DEC, in various products, probably some others. I think they had a few weird AMD bitslice CPU's in some embedded things. Today ""Apple Silicon"" CPU's are designed at Apple but manufactured at -- you guessed it -- TSMC. How important are high end chips to the US defence establishment? They basically aren't. Defense has long product acquisition cycles. There's a ton of tanks and missiles and stuff using chips from the 1980's that are still in service. But the US economy is utterly dependent on modern chips, and the US economy is very important to the US defense establishment because ultimately US interests are what they are defending. So is the whole TSMC issue just blown up a lot for political reasoning? There's an element of it, sure. Politicians don't really understand the semiconductor industry, so they sometimes say stupid things. But right now the world is shockingly dependent on TSMC for the way the modern economy works. They won the economic/tech war before the politicians even noticed anything. Or are they purely looking at it from an economic standpoint from the impact it will have on the consumer electronics industry(where there's a strong demand for high tech, cutting edge chips).  The industry has become amazingly dependent on TSMC's economies of scale . No entity in human history has every manufactured a quantity of countable things at the scale the TSMC manufactures transistors . Wont sell before 240 Gotta catch Nvidia",-6
2024-01-19,AMD Gain Porn So uh I just woke up Tuesday and thought Hmmm AMD about to hit ATHs maybe itll do what Nvidia did I got 11k to spare for risky option plays so should Iyeahwhy not Then decided not to sell today cause why the fuck not Damn you really let your whole nuts hang You should probably take profits but you probably wonAMD Will sell Monday or Tuesday Just banking on another day or two of momentum Either way if this somehow dumps enough on those days to really fuck me over I can afford to lose it The 11k is pretty much just spare money I set aside for risky plays Single digit percentage of my portfolio Yl inspired me Refreshing to see a wealthsimple screenshot on WSB Now this is impressive I honestly wouldnbe surprised if this gets over 200 after ER Chip market is going nuts right now and every technical indicator for this stock is extremely bullish on most time frames Congrats Enjoy the gains while it last Hopefully I sell before the dump I had that exact position I closed it out for an 85 loss 4 weeks ago AMD removes Taiwan branding from CPUs says change wasnt made to appease China The new label says de near China Yeah thats gonna piss them off just as much Sure keep telling yourself that Fine then put it back on there AMD CCPU It might be as much due to diversification of manufacture location as anything else Everyone is worried that putting all your eggs in one basket whether that is Taiwan or China is going to blow up in their faces if China decides it wants to invade Taiwan Dont all imports need the country of origin marked Products have made in x because its law not national pride I mean duh I can accept it cause there is already a wall of text cluster and Made in Malaysia on it so putting Diffused in Taiwan while we already know its printed by tsmc is a bit dumb I mean you can engrave Made in Taiwan on the ones that are and Made in USA in the ones made here In to some degree itd be easier as then they wouldnt have had to change anything at their fab Its just you Even though its rising I wont sell so that When the next cycle comes Ill buy again Middle East War Israel advances into Iran and Pakistan across the Red Sea As Pakistan launched retaliatory airstrikes against Iran two days after it was attacked by Iran the Middle East war is expanding beyond Israel and the Red Sea to the entire Middle East Pakistans foreign ministry said today it had launched airstrikes on an antiPakistan terrorist hideout in southern Iran Pakistan carried out retaliatory airstrikes two days after the attack by Iran which killed seven foreigners in Iran it said The conflict between the two countries triggered by Irans attack on Pakistan has risen to the highest level and the Middle East war is expanding to the entire Middle East CNBC warned that if Irans Strait of Hormuz is blocked crude oil supply will be severely damaged making it difficult to compare with the Red Sea blockade Wall Street Journal NVDA bears rn Good lord at this rate NVDA is going to break through 600 by Monday That is a monster Ive never realized the shear size of bears next to a human before A strict diet of NVDA calls Guys am I wallstreating correctly How how TF did you lose money as the stock increases Yes youre doing rwsb correctly If youre not making money off 0DTE NVDA calls what are you doing Michael Burry has left the room I putting all capital in the company that miniaturizes and domestics a brown bear I just went all in this morning  praying to the NVDA gods to moon tonight Will post total later  What have you done You god damn know it going to tank now Guys NVDA being overvalued is outdated news Yeah after the May 2023 spike it was not a great buy But it was roughly flat for like 6 months after that The expected value of the company continued rising while the price stayed flat converging the price back to fair value It was even a little bit undervalued in October Get with the times NVDA isnt a pumpdump Its a rapidly growing company with unmitigated future profit potential Everyday there news about how needed the company is and new deals for GPUS as well The best companies in the world regarding tech can exist currently without NVDA  Bro look at those fucking claws Bet he never needs scissors to open up a package Who in their right mind would short nvda or amd  Just a 15 trilly company that earns a lil 9 billy Yup my small spec long term put position is annihilated I am a short baggie right now Dont even need to look at the NVDA stock price because it is going to always be up 3  Quite simply NVDA is an infinite money machine Sold everything Lets get some Nvidia shares Stock bonanza It was a prosperous year I sold half of my holdings in June and held on but I should have held onto them all The national market was good for swing trades and I hit the jackpot Now that the Broadcom target price that I set on January 1st has been achieved its better not to be greedy and clean up without regrets There is no peak Haha 2000 this year lets go Too cheap lets go to 500 Its such a good deal Lets buy 500 worth of Nvidia shares Will NVDA ever get back down to 500 Will NVDA get back down to 500 in 2024 Why Yes when the stock splits I believe NVDA will hit 700 before it touches 500 Honestly they have a pretty strong business moat for today and perhaps the next few years Its not going to see 500 again any time soon  maybe after the next stock split  Sure market is volatile Yep only honest answer All these clowns in here acting like strong fundamentals and growth mean a stock cant go down are in for a rude fucking awakening lol If China invades Taiwan it could get down to 200 but if peace prevail it could go much higher In other words who the hell knows Thats a pretty big if Taiwan is backed by the US which has active and express security stake with Taiwan China will not be spared Taiwan has been beefing up their military as well and a physical conflict will put a major dent in Chinas economy Not to mention the international response will also not be pleasant for China Unless China loses its effing mind it will stay clear of Taiwan I am not an expert but I A gamblerand barring a huge unforeseen circumstance no  lol no It was under 500 for almost 5 months even after 2 jawdropping earnings reports from a 1 Trillion dollar company Where were you Anyone can look at a 10 yr chart of this company and understand its history is volatile The only question is how high above 500 does it peak before it retraces 20 40 100 Donno Its on a run right now but that run is going to pause at some point and folks are gonna take profits Thats the fundamental question with this stock is your posture trying to call the peaks and valleys in a trade or are you playing it for the long term In the end management is doing the right thing to grow the company so the long term share price trend is going to be up imo This company isnt CSCO and the opportunity isnt novel internet traffic with a dozen competitors offering similar IP,-4
2024-01-20,AMD sigh Its a bargain Really cheap Lets grab it quickly So cheap Still too cheap Is an average price of 115 okay Too cheap NVIDIA is at 600 Is it because the stock is severely overvalued Please enlighten me Why is the PE ratio close to 1300 They always seem to disappoint shareholders every year Thank you Youre not investing in this stock Trailing PSR 14 times Looking at leading Nasdaq stocks if the PSR is over 12 times thats considered a bubble Ultimately without showing numbers further increase would venture into bubble territory,-6

2024-01-22,"Breaking news Yonhap News January 22 24 1020 AM News US stocks hit alltime high Observation Its unlikely to rise further SJ Crisis NVIDIAs semiconductor is expensive so they are planning to produce it inhouse Currently in the AI semiconductor market NVIDIAs graphics processing unit GPU accounts for 90 This is driving me crazy Exynos 2500 leak - 10 core, 3nm. May outperform TSMC 3nm. It's going to be funny as fuck if pixel switches to TSMC right when samsung finally surpasses them. Sounds about right for Google, lol Knowing Google, they'd do exactly that lol Didn?셳 Apple face issues with A17 pro with TSMC 3 nm ? Actually quite interested in Samsung's 3nm process. Rumors about it being better than TSMC have been floating around for a while but they haven't used it for any comparable chips so far. We don't even know how 2400 performs in real life use yet, and we already have informations on the next one lmao. Why are Samsung still using a520 cores , while mediatek and qcom have been slowly abandoning it ? Samsung Foundries starting to sound like Ferrari F1 fans. This will be the year. Next year will be the year. Samsung's history tells that don't believe in these rumours until product is delivered and reviewed by multiple independent reviewers and end users. Past rumors always told us they Samsung's next chip is going to surpass everyone but in reality this never happened. May outperform TSMC 3nm. (X) Doubt Gonna take quite a few above average generations for me to ever even look at an smartphone with Exynos again, the S20 was one of the worst phones I've ever owned. Every year they say the same sht and then it becomes an ironer in the hands. I'm done believing this sht until I see it. You can say shit on Reddit lol /s. I only care about efficiency when comparing flagship SoCs. You'll hardly see any SoC being stressed to 100% unless you're really trying like benchmarks etc. Waiting for someone to do actually efficiency test between the two and that'll be the only deciding factor imo. I swear I've head this so many times now over the years. Not expecting much until it actually happens.  Samsung has claimed they would be a node leader for multiple generations, they always come up short . Only Intel and TSMC have proven they could be on top for years . People were hopeful for Samsung 3GAP but after 3GAE failed to exist outside a handful of crypto miners . It seems Samsung Foundry is gradually failing. Their advertised 2nm density is even worse than TSMC 3nm! Only 1 cortex x5? That is the problem. Even tho it may have 3nm but with 10 cores + poor core distribution + below average gpu will make it bad. Below average gpu? The 2400?셲 gpu has already surpassed Qualcomm?셲 Guys this stock Lets aim for 5x The pirates ghost I think that the pirates ghost is one of the best stories in the mignolaverse I love the end of wald and I could picture it so clearly I?셫 my head and the art is so amazing One of my faves as well.

Seems like the MO for certain lawfirms to launch these suits whenever a stock price drops. No one ever gets a dime! Short sellers using AI to induce fear and drop stock prices with fake/frivolous lawsuits? I wonder what someone has to gain by encouraging stock holders to sell. Is it possible there's millions on the line for some short sellers? Who'd a thunk it? Buy and hold my friends. Weak hands give the power to the shorties.  The lawsuits they release on recently shorted companies are similar with similar timelines with all J capital short reports . I called one of them today, had to repeated microvast 3 times before the receptionist understood what suit I was talking about, then kept asking what company I was with . Yeah I'm sure they have no idea what's going on as it looks like the lawsuit announcements are automatically generated. Balony lawsuits is my assessment until I find evidence to the contrary. Great due diligence man keep it up if you try anyone else let us know! Idiot Care to elaborate? ?? Still wondering what you meant by that. Crisis ASML lowers revenue forecast due to Chinese regulations this year Newsis news Despite record performance this year conservative outlook why ASML is still Setback ASML adjusts revenue downward due to Chinese regulations this year News today NVDA options suggestions I am curious to know more about pursuing to buy a call option soon, with a strike amount of about 200-300. Any suggestions on what to understand or when to sell the stock after it hits or goes above the market value that I bought the option at the time? Very very new to this. You are clueless because 1. NVDA call options at 2-300 is going to be tens of thousand of dollars if not hundreds, since its already above $300 You should be doing more research as you don?셳 know how options work it sounds like When you buy a call option, you are buying the right to own 100 shares at the strike you chose by the expiration date you chose. You pay a premium based on the strike & expiration essentially. Once you purchase or sell an option contract, you pay or receive the premium. From there, you can exercise the contract which means you actually buy the 100 shares at whatever price the stock is at and what option you have.  If you don't exercise the option, you never have ownership of shares . You can buy/sell the contract itself with the goal of profiting off the premiums but not the shares themselves . When you say ?쐃xercise??you mean either buying the call options after expiration, or selling the call option and profiting off the premium right? I haven?셳 really found good tutorials of physically see a profit example in real time as of yet. Consume some educational content before jumping into options. Or start with something cheaper. My first options were on NOK and I had learned about how the Greeks describe option price. The options you described should perform very similar to owning a the stock. Probably dont want to let it expire. Just skip it. You will lose money. You?셪l make more in a HYSA. what?셲 your goal? why did you pick 200-300 as the strike? All I could afford lol, if I?셫 not mistaken, strike is the x value you pay in terms of the price of the stock * 100, correct? And the market value is what we would want the stock to break even by or go above when placing a call option correct? You don't have to buy the stock at any point when buying options to trade . . .  You would buy to open paying a debit amount from your account, then when selling to close if the option price has risen it can result in a profit . Think of buying stock at a price and making a profit if the stock value goes up, this is the same when buying options . When to sell to close, assuming the option price moves up and there is a profit, is a hard question to answer. There are no standards and it is up to you and your analysis of the stock movement, but it is impossible to guess when the option will be at the top. See this recent post where when to close long options are talked about - https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/19dukyj/options_questions_safe_haven_thread_jan_2228_2024/kjdm8u7/?context=3 Tell me your target and thoughts...you looking for a medium to long play or just short term...you think it'll go up to where and in what time ?

As the confrontation between Western forces centered on the United States and Yemens proIranian rebel Houthis over the Red Sea reached its peak day after day the global logistics artery the Red Sea was blocked and the logistics crisis became a reality
It means that supply chains can be disrupted for at least a few months there can be no winners there will only be losers AP Moller Musk Group CEO Vincent Kler told the World Economic Forum There will be a shortage of container ships compared to logistics volume starting in two weeks said Tobias Meyer CEO of DHL Group The price of using 40foot containers rose more than 15 earlier this month and the logistics crisis also began when ships became scarce due to increased operational distance said Drury CEO of a shipping consulting firm

This data may contain errors. Q4 2023 Key Points: Profit and Revenue: Revenue declined to $4.08 billion from $4.67 billion in Q4 2022, a significant decrease. Gross profit dropped from $3.1 billion to $2.43 billion. Economic Trends and Market Conditions: The call highlighted issues with underutilization and adjustments to factory loadings, indicating a response to market demands and inventory levels. Management's Tone and Strategy: Management discussed maintaining a pricing strategy despite market challenges, suggesting a focus on long-term stability over short-term gains. Dividends and Shareholder Returns: Dividends per common share increased from $1.24 to $1.30, showing a commitment to shareholder returns despite financial challenges. Year-Over-Year Comparison: Revenue and Profit Decline: There was a notable decline in both revenue and profit year-over-year, indicating challenging market conditions in 2023. Market Segments Shift: While automotive remained strong in both years, the industrial sector's performance seemed to have weakened in 2023. Strategic Focus and Response to Economic Trends: The company maintained a strategic focus on industrial and automotive sectors, but faced challenges in utilization and market demand, leading to adjustments in factory loadings. Shareholder Returns: Despite financial challenges, TXN continued to increase dividends, showing a strong commitment to shareholder value. Stock Price Analysis: 2022 Performance: The stock may have been positively influenced by the company's solid performance in automotive and industrial segments, along with generous shareholder returns. 2023 Challenges: The drop in revenue and profit, along with operational challenges, could have negatively impacted the stock price. The company's consistent dividend increase, however, may have provided some stability. Overall Insights: Texas Instruments has faced significant challenges in 2023, with decreased revenue and profitability compared to 2022. The company's strategic focus remains on the industrial and automotive sectors, but the industrial sector has shown weakness in 2023. Despite economic challenges, TXN has maintained its commitment to shareholder returns through consistent dividend increases. Operational adjustments reflect a response to changing market demands and inventory management challenges. The stock's performance is likely impacted by these financial and operational challenges, but the commitment to shareholder returns may have provided some support. The reaction to this truly terrible quarter and guide was interesting - a mix of price adjustments down and others up. I view the quarter as the kitchen-sink quarter - the rock bottom or maybe a quarter from rock bottom. I was hoping for a significant flush the day after earnings so I could buy some more, but that never happened. TXN will likely begin to recover by the end of the year, but probably won't reach it's glory days anytime soon; still, a strong compounder to hold over time - a cornerstone-type stock. Agreed What?셲 interesting in the chip space right now, feels like auto and industrial are seeing weakness. Feels like they were strong the few years, but with autos, feels like it?셲 slowing. NXPI, MobileEye, AEHR, all taking about slowdowns. Also STM reported this morning with a revenue miss. Curious as someone new to this sub Reddit, why do you think TXN has better days to come? Vertrekkend ASML-topman: als we niet hier kunnen groeien, doen we dat elders Aanval op groen groeiende antimigratie positie in politiek ASML is een zeer belangrijke organisatie (geworden), en dat weten ze zelf natuurlijk ook donders goed. Als bedrijf zijnde heb je ambities, en dat is in het geval van ASML een combinatie van slimmer, beter en ook groter worden. Tegelijkertijd ziet ASML dat thuishonk Veldhoven uit zijn voegen barst. Lange tijd is de rode loper uitgerold geweest, en dat heeft de regio mooie dingen gebracht. Echter staat die rode loper nu tot de nok toe vol met expats, en is de rol volledig uitgerold. Het huisvesten van (nieuwe) werknemers wordt een steeds grotere uitdaging, en bij bouwen is momenteel geen optie. Daarnaast ziet ASML ook een steeds verder strekkende arm van de VS, waar de Nederlandse overheid totaal geen rugdekking weet te bieden. In plaats daarvan gaat de arm van de VS via het poepertje van onze demissionair premier naar het beleid toe in de vorm van exportbeperkingen, waar ASML last van heeft. De huidige formatie en het huidige demissionaire kabinet lijken daar (vooralsnog) geen oplossing in te bieden, maar maken het ASML n처g lastiger door o.a. de expatregelingen uit te kleden. Is het dan logisch dat ASML zich hardop af gaat vragen wat voor de organisatie de beste vervolgstap is, om de bedrijfsambities te realiseren? Mijn antwoord is kort: Ja, dat is logisch. En dat hoeft niet per se gunstig te zijn voor Brainport / Nederland. ASML heeft Nederland niet nodig. Kan je lang of kort over ouwehoeren, maar zo is het nu eenmaal. Daarnaast ziet ASML ook een steeds verder strekkende arm van de VS, waar de Nederlandse overheid totaal geen rugdekking weet te bieden. Dit is een probleem overal in de Westerse wereld, ze gaan zeker niet naar Azi챘 ivm de aanwezige risicofactoren van bedrijfsspionage. Waar gaan ze dan heen? Ze willen graag dicht bij een haven zitten voor vervoer van hun eindproduct en voor toelevering van productie onderdelen zijn ze deels afhankelijk van EU bedrijven (Zeiss voor glas bijv.). Dat zou wel een klap zijn, maar het slaat nergens op. De 4 partijen die nu aan het onderhandelen zijn willen ze niet per se in de weg staan en zijn zeker niet tegen migranten die uitzicht op banen hebben. en zijn zeker niet tegen migranten die uitzicht op banen hebben Maar ondertussen blijven ze wel janken dat er een ernstig tekort aan huisvesting is vanwege migranten. ASML, en andere grote bedrijven die veel gebruik maken van migranten, mogen wat mij betreft ook eens wat meer voor eigen huisvesting zorgen. Leuk dat ze de huur betalen bij een pandjesbaas, maar zo zit je Nederlanders w챕l in de weg. Ga weer eens arbeiderswijken/flats bouwen. Nationaliseren die boel Niks aan gelogen toch. ASML medewerkers strippen de regionale huizenmarkt al tot frustratie van de kleine gemeenten er omheen wiens kinderen geen huis kunnen krijgen. ASML betaalt namelijk heel erg aardig, en al helemaal als je wat kunt. Ze zullen woord bij daad moeten voegen en meefinancieren op de huizenmarkt. Bijzonder dat ze doen als Philips spinoff, die deden dat namelijk honderd jaar terug ook in Eindhoven. Ik wil als degelijke linkse ziel eigenlijk zeggen dat bedrijven minder het handje op moeten houden, en meer bereidt moeten zijn om in de gemeenschap te investeren. De goede oude schouders eronder mentaliteit, niet ik ruil jou dan wel in voor een ander. Zoiets kan tot weinig anders dan bedelen leiden. Dat dit nu onder de druk van extreemrechts moet gebeuren is wel pure hilariteit. Toch leuk dat het in ieder geval grappig is. We delen een probleem: de economische groei is niet het einddoel, en we streven naar iets anders. Van de 챕챕n op de ander: Succes is jullie in een bepaalde zin gegund. Rechtse hobbies gaan een punt van discussie worden nu jullie niet meer op een voornamelijk economisch platform jullie ding doen. Als het niet duidelijk is: ik wil het er even flink inwrijven. Het plezier is jullie oprecht gegund. Dat dit nu onder de druk van extreemrechts moet gebeuren is wel pure hilariteit. Maar dat is toch helemaal prima? Is het echt zo'n probleem voor Nederland als ASML ook grote vestigingen heeft in andere Europese landen? Het lijkt mij vanuit een breder perspectief ook redelijk problematisch dat 1 bedrijf in 1 land een single point of failure is voor technologie die essentieel is voor de wereldeconomie. Vertaling: 'Val ons en onze werknemers niet lastig met regels en belastingen, anders vertrekken we.' Vertaling van Billy: ik heb het artikel half gelezen en weet alles beter. Ik denk niet dat jij tolk moet worden, Nederlands -> Nederlands lijkt al wat problemen op te leveren Lijkt me logisch toch? Of nog meer kansloze importeren? Noem een land war dit niet zo werkt. ASML heeft Nederland echt niet nodig hoor. Mensen met talent moeten beloond worden zou eens tijd worden dit door te pakken op meer locaal niveau. Werken moet beloond worden, waarom kan het alleen voor talentvolle expats is de enige vraag die ik dan heb.",0

Who gives a damn if their laptop and server business is dying? The future is AI. The drop we?셱e seeing in aftermarket for both NVDA and AMD is unrelated to what they are producing compared to Intel.

2024-01-26,"AMD 176 Tesla 183 Who will rise quicker ASML Monopoly Noob here. Just curious how much of a monopoly ASML has on the semiconductor market. Is there anybody anywhere close to generating a lithography system similar to ASML's precision? Also just curious how they've managed to get to this position. Thanks in advance!! Toured the ASML factory a couple of years ago (looked at buying a tool), they said the DUV tools (the ones used for below 10 nm nodes), are in excess of $200M and takes up to 200 engineers 12 months to install. These tools are immensely complicated and took years to develop, and billions invested.  ASML has dominance for below 45 nm, probably below 90 nm . Canon and Nikon are the other two big players in the market .  It is extremely difficult to get into this market from scratch... Lots of smaller companies that focus on unique markets . Some backend processes require this, so ASML/Canon/Nikon are too expensive for these processes . Whew?쫈an?셳 imagine the position you?셱e in if you?셱e getting to tour their freakin factory. What?셲 DUV? Or did you mean EUV? And, what?셲 the PVD you mentioned in relation to applied materials? Carl Zeiss is the only company in the world producing the necessary mirrors for ASML. So if you look even deeper in those supply chains you will find many companys which have a monopoly and can't be replaced. Adding to most people's comments. I worked a little while ago at ASML for about five years in the EUV program (source and illuminator).  There are only a couple of BIG fish out there (such as: Intel, Samsung, TSMS, Global Foundries) and if you reach a node with a good overlay, consistent throughout and machine availability, you get a big chunk of the market for that node . The competition (today, mostly Cannon and Nikon) would have to reach the  ASML is exploring issues that are not described even in physics papers . This is not something that is easily copied, even if someone has a machine in front . You need engineers to tell you WHY a running was done in a particular way, or how one machine solves a specific problem compared to another .  The latest tools are just mad. Create a droplet of tin, then hit it with a single laser pulse to create photons of a specific frequency . ASML and Intel have a very close relationship as well. Intel invest billions into ASML to develop the next generation of tools . Nope, not even close. Outside of China, no-one?셲 even seriously trying either. 40 years of hard work, dominant position in the market and putting the money back into R&D to make sure you keep that position. Outside of China, no-one?셲 even seriously trying either. Not quite true https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/13/canon-launches-asml-challenge-with-machine-to-make-most-advanced-chips.html At iline, 248nm the Canon and Nikon tools perform comparably for a lower price. Unless they?셶e made progress in the last few years, they are not competitive at 193 immersion. Nanoimprint is interesting tech but doesn?셳 hold up in mass production so far, mostly for overlay issues. They are investing and making progress but nothing like ASML EUV. I wrote this article a while back explaining more about ASML?셲 monopoly. The article is not as technical as some of the other comments but hopefully provides some business perspective.

If P9 has 4nm Samsung chips. It's probably better to wait for P10 which might have 3nm TSMC chips Just consider that the Exynos 2400 of the Galaxy S24 lineup has proven to be a super major improvement over the Exynos/Samsung offering of the last 2-3 years. Even though it's not up there with the Snap8G3, it comes extremely close to it and in a couple of GPU tests is even beats it. This means Tensor G4 may very likely be not that bad after all (rumoured to have the same configuration as G3 but with X4/A720/A520 cores and with Mali-G720MC7, and it will probably benefit of the improvements shown by Samsung with the Exynos 2400). In addition to that, the Pixel 10 lineup with TSMC-manufactured SoC will likely come with a huge price bump. And don't expect Tensor G5 to compete with Qualcomm, Mediatek or Apple either, because even though yes it'll be manufactured by TSMC which has in the last few years provided better yield than Samsung fabs, the entire IP will probably be developed in-house by Google which - in SoC design - lacks experience even when compared to Samsung Semiconductor. i wonder about the efficiency gains on the 8g3 over the exy2400 Right on the spot I would pick up the Pixel 9 then wait for the pixel 11 you never want to get the first phone with changes. Remember Pixel 6 issues and pixel 7 got way better. I think that it's Samsung still. No TSMC until P10. I have a iPhone 14 Pro Max my thing is use it until the pixel 11 and iPhone 18 come out then decide on the upgrade with TSMC switch if Google uses a Qualcomm modem then it makes sense will sure know before in typically google leak fashion Or you can wait for Pixel 12 they wil have sub nano SoC 3 picometers SoCs coming up Is such a small transistor size even possible? Exynos 2400 Based on the exynos 2400 so Samsung It is NOT based on Exynos. You can't base on something then swap out the CPU cluster, the GPU, the NPU, the codec and remove the modem. That's 80% of the SOC area. You are far far better off starting from nothing. They are drawing some IP blocks from the same source Exynos team did. All they have in common is the IO and parts of the codec. If anything Tensor G4 will be based on Tensor G3. Hope they stick with Samsung, looking at tests the Snap Dragon 8 Gen 3 throttles harder than any other chip today people really gotta get over this idea of thermal throttle. While it obviously throttles from peak.....it sustains at a level above every chip on the market besides Apples newest A series. While Google's TSMC would be huge, it won't hit the ground running right away but I'll be waiting for it.  Rumors go around that Google is switching to the next hot thing: a Samsung chip . The P13 will be Google's first-gen TSMC chip, so you will wait for the P11 . But then you look at the P8 and remember what a disappointing refresh this was . This might be the last year for Samsung's fabrication. https://www.androidauthority.com/google-tensor-new-chip-tester-3404499/ Samsung. Pixel 10 (Tensor G5) will be with TSMC I'm still debating I'm tired of Samsung chips honestly but the pixel 9 looks really good Not might, will have. Tensor 4 does get a better version of 4nm which probably won't amount to a huge improvement but it's something. Vendor Says ""No AMD Support"" is this normal?  A major car manufacturer in their equipment guidelines says ""no AMD"" and have refused to troubleshoot unrelated issues due to this . I was curious if there was any merit in them choosing not to support that chip . I feel like years ago there may have been some differences that could cause issues but I haven't seen any issues with software for a We're missing some context here. Generally speaking, however, a vendor claiming not to support AMD is three times as hilarious as when vendors used to claim not to support virtualization. There's no chance they think you mean ""ARM"", is there? I once had a client with a software that supported hyper v and VMware virtualization but not kvm. They accomplished this by having their software check msinfo32 for what type of VM it was being run on and refuse to run if it detected kvm. Geez I once had a vendor who didn't support virtualization for their license server. This was some very specialized scientific software. Outside of that specific field of science and higher ed no one would have ever heard of this software.  When I was told this college was buying the software I looked everything over and said it shouldn't be an issue . Well come to find out the publisher was based out of Estonia so there was a language barrier . We had 4 licenses and due to policies related to servers we had to spend $1200 on a server just to run a license manager for Vendors as a general rule will do anything to limit their costs to support a product. Right up there with software vendors who don???really understand virtualization and recommend VMs running 16-32 cores and 128 GB of RAM to run all the consolidated services, functions and databases for their application. And don't forget vendors saying you need a minimum 500GB hard drive for their 30GB app+DB Talking about Chevy's software minimum requirements for programming tools? Because yeah they're something special lol... Ding ding ding. As far as I can tell the requirements are for the whole dealership but yes the programming tools are the ones where the techs will call in and get told that their system isn't supported. Car manufacturer... I've seen the quality of infotainment and other software systems from car manufacturers. They have no clue what they are talking about and probably are just being stupid, because they are.  I've seen it from other places also, blaming everything on the fact that the server was virtualized and on AMD EPYC and blah blah blah . Blame blame blame blame and then it turns out their software was just broken . Developers fixed it and eventually they added AMD and virtualization to their support list . Yeah the car manufacturers are scrambling to keep up with technology at all. I heard some horror stories about bugs in firmware for radios, the radio has the start button for the car as part of it, and after their issues the only fix is to replace the radio but with a few thousand being needed across the country suddenly they are all on back order. Anyway my company asked if I could upgrade the computer and the vendors site says you can only use Intel, AMD processors are not compatible. I found that highly unlikely and tried the software on an AMD Ryzen 5600 and a 3060ti, works flawlessly, the golf bros said it???never been so smooth and responsive. Some vendors are just lazy and don???want to bother testing on more than one system.  Once upon a time I had to work with extremely outdated hardware to support a manufacturers systems . They couldn't update the systems due to the process of recertification of code for the EPA . So basically they kept around old hardware and old cross compilers because changing anything out would mean even the smallest firmware patch to their product would require full EPA rec What I???getting at. There is probably nothing wrong with AMD, but there could be other legal factors involved. I'd say regulatory over legal, but that's me being nitpicky. There's probably not a scenario where AMD CPUs will negatively impact their software. But still, that doesn't matter. They're not a software company producing a word processor sold on the shelves of Office Depot in 2003, that needs to be tested & guaranteed to run on every platform in every conceivable hardware combination that can run Windows. If you want their support, get their specs, so they don't have to waste time guessing, troubleshooting, and debugging all the shit they didn't test in-house. This goes for every vendor. Since AMD made the x64 instruction set, and license it to Intel... Well... Maybe they??켩 talking about graphics? There???a lot of stuff out there that was written using the CUDA compute framework, which only works on NVIDIA graphics cards. Nope, they don't support AMD processors at all at the dealership. Is it GM? Their technician laptop requirements are really overkill. We deployed rugged laptops but had to replace them because the screens were too small. So just buy an Intel system. When working with a vendor it's easiest to just do what they want. Every once in a while we run into some issue with an AMD server but it's usually an edge case, like having multiple GPU's in a server and then some odd BIOS or kernel setting you have change. Almost always resolvable. Unless it's some instruction that one chip vendor doesn't support or they do but it's way, way slower. Install on Intel, move drive to AMD. When support is needed, move the drive to Intel, test that the problem persists, then call support.",4

2024-01-29,AMDnew CPU hits 132fps in Fortnite without a graphics card  Also get 49fps in BG3 119fps in CS2 and 41fps in Cyberpunk 2077 using the new AMD Ryzen 8700G all without the need for an extra CPU cooler These are great APUs I built a PC for my niece but all she does is play Roblox so I put a 3400G in there It actually runs amazing Anything else would have been overkill Theres definetily a solid market for these But not this one Its so expensive you could just buy a CPU and GPU that perform better instead without hitting the price of this part I think people overestimate its usefulness At least at that price point I can see the low end graphics card become redundant in the future Mid and high end are certainly not under threat Feels like what happened to digital home cameras like the Nikon Coolpix that many of us remember from relentless cable advertising Once smartphone cameras took off nobody needed a camera anymore so the only ones that survived were actually good photography cameras Thats always been the holy grail for budget and laptop gamers 8700g is more expensive than 5700g6500xt which does 200fps in fortnite and better in other games as well Go watch Hardware Unboxed Video on it No doubt its a great Product but the price is not justified Good for a mini pc that canfit a gpu I see this being useful for HTPC builds rather than having the best price to performance An traCPU cooler How many coolers do you guys use I only ever have the one Its nice and all but its very expensive For the developing handheld market things like the Steam Deck this will be great lol No This processor consumes close to 80W in single core gaming mode A steam deck with a 40Wh battery would get  30 min of play time This is an evolution for consoles mini PCs and in the future for laptops still likely plugged in AMD Z1 Extreme has a max TDP of 30W with 12 GPU cores and 8 CPU cores The custom valve AMD solution is 8 GPU cores with 4 CPU cores has a max TDP of 15W Desktop grade APUs like this one would be very brutal on the steam deck battery I donthink we will be seeing these APUs in a form factor beyond just NUCs and tiny machines that are battery independent The laptop equivalent being the R9 8945HS and 7940HS with meGPU runs into issue with 45W becoming difficult to cool with the exception of heavy laptops that offer vapor chambers or brute force heatsinks and fins I would eat my words if anyone manages to shove a mobile R9 7940HS or a 8700G in a normal handheld and it has a battery life thatmeasured in anything but minutes For those wondering the GPU is a wellknown Radeon 780M Stupid question Could I combine the graphics power of the cpu with my existing nvidia graphics card Not really no at least not in a way that would be similar SLI with multiple GPUs running a single appgame It is possible to run seperate processes on the integrated  discrete graphics but theres few real world applications youd use it for you can see an example of it with crypto miners that are designed to run multiple threads for multiple cards though Can someone explain what is ment by an extra CPU cooler Was the expectation youneed two different CPU coolers it comes with a stock cooler that keeps it cool So you dont have to buy an extra one to stop overheating Ie just using the stock cooler in the box Its all good but can it run Crysis Really January 30th 7 pm Is this the right time Tomorrow evening at 7 pm Korean time AMDs 4th quarter earnings announcement is set for Tuesday January 30 2024 US local time In Korean time it will be disclosed at 7 pm on Tuesday January 30 This What do you think,6

httpswwwearningsdigestaistockanalyzeAMD2023Q4 1000 999 Man this earnings call really triggered a lot of people Look how big this thread is half of it seems like BS Seems like we got all the Nvidia fanboys out in force today This is what happens when people invest based off emotion and not fundamentals I look forward to the buying opportunity I liked the color Lisa provided on customer concentration a year or two from now She doesnt believe one or two customers will be responsible for half of the revenue Hopefully that means less sweetheart deals like the one Microsoft is presumably getting It means console business would be weak over next few years their top customer has been Sony and Microsoft MI300 would be bought by all the biggies it would be interesting to see how much Capex is spent by them vs NVDAs solution which sells like hot cakes Ive been in since 2017 and average cost for my 3900 shares is just under 18 I am holding until end of 2025 at the earliest AMDnew CPU hits 132fps in Fortnite without a graphics card Stock down Marketing up The super annoying part is that these high end APUs usually get bundled on high end laptopsdesktops that also come with powerful graphics cards You almost never see these things come standalone on a well priced laptop Basically defeating the purpose of its existence It probably provides a nice battery boost while gaming on the go while still providing decent performance Whilst they arent doing themselves any favours with the high price for this CPU it will become a no brainer for many circumstances when prices drop right I alwayse use a discrete GPU but I am loving the benchmarks it being an APU this is about the first time an APU properly does what its been trying to do and I suspect will get so many more

by xiaolongbao6969 ASML  The Maker of Lithography Machines Used for Making Almost All the Advanced Chips in the World Just Published This Video Man the future is gonna be wild Humanity is beautiful Seriously wild Ever gone 060 in a model S plaid I havent but I hear it can be very uncomfortable  Change is coming fast Its accelerating as fast as a plaid and will likey be just as uncomfortable And thats before it goes even faster Soon this will be super smooth and youll be able to do it at home This company never needed a promotion and they will never need that I assume that this video is more than a statement than advertisement I believe and hope that they are preparing for something great Fantastic video I love the 70s computer era aesthetics in the one shot Daily reminder to watch Blackberry if you havent seen it The lithography processes weve developed are absolutely mind blowing  A controversial claim I want to make here is I think were reaching the limits of human cognitive capacity with these systems Thats instead of reaching the limits of the materials or physical limits We have a limited cognitive capacity I feel terrible that this is still a controversial claim As a result of our limits we cannot make systems limitlessly complex  But we can setup the systems to develop themselves However this almost certainly guarantees that at some point well lose sight of how all of this works and we may never understand it again Our biggest error with this entire technological process is that we collectively believe that we own this process and entirely understand it At that we must understand it and control it to make progress This is more a discovery process than a process we control or entirely understand I think we could probably develop AI significantly faster if we were far more reckless These AI systems seem to be utilizing inherent elements of the universe which we didnt invent but rather discovered Such as fundamental laws  And so we should probably stop fooling ourselves into thinking this process is limited Technological progress itself isnt the limit We are the limit For now FYI 3nm transistors were first made in 2006 using Ebeam lithographyelectrons ASML uses scalable EUV lithographyphotons for the same But did you know that if you remove the 3rd spatial dimension2D space entirely basically 0nm you get a mix called anyons They are quasiparticles with a partial charge partial charges aren possible with electrons People claim there 2D materials like graphenea single atom is 3D and there this thing called a 2D electron gas also not truly 2D But anyons only exist at 10 mK because heat itself expands the 2D space into 3D with vibrations So much so that they discovered phonons can traverse a vacuum when they made the Anyon experiments they failed the first time when they used boron nitride which conducts phonons quite well Thank god the video isn in swamp german I excited for the future There are future trillionaires in this sub among us right now If it you Il invest It me Invest right now 1 a month ASs Machine Learning Great company This actually gave me goosebumps Well done video and for it to come from them We live in a spectacular time whatever happens next there is no doubt about that ELI5 Future is wild Its a pity that ASML is probably the only big company in Europe thats actually important as well at present one of the most important along with TSMC All the other big companies in Europe are either fashion perfume or cosmetic brand or some other bullshit And then the decels at the EU put out even more regulations to restrict tech and more people leave for other places Its just fucking sad to see Europe disappear into irrelevancy You have no clue lol Working for an AMD partner and they

2024-01-31,AMD only computer I am planning on upgrading my GPU and giving my RTX 2070 to my friend but says he cant take it apparently because his PC only works with AMD GPUs Ive never heard of that option in my life Is this true Are there PCs that only take AMD GPUs Buying NVIDIA is wise With this quarters earnings report AMD has realized that they still cant compete with Nvidia Meh Earnings call UMC reports Q4 results projects cautious 2024 outlook and along camemicrosoft Honestly isnt this totally forced The 4th quarter consensus was met and the operating profit margin for the first quarter of this year exceeds the forecast Is it justifiable to deduct 3 billion just because the revenue fell short by 3 billion compared to the expected 57 billion hitting 54 billion I totally fell for the its so cheap trap  It plummeted by 7 today alone resulting in a loss of 7 million Ill sell at the target price of 200 HODL Is this gambling or what kekekeke This feels like pure gambling what on earth I feel like losing my mind Isnt AMD extremely overpriced am I missing something Comparing AMD to Nvidia Nvidia is well positioned to continue to be the dominant gpu maker for AI and AMD is not Nvidia has a PE ratio of 82 Amd has a PE ratio of 327 Why would anyone would invest in a stock with a poorer outlook than nvidia and a higher PE It seems extremely overpriced Maybe I am just a noob tho and missing something here just commenting on the PE ratio its inflated due to the Xilinx acquisition Their earnings are greatly reduced by amortization of their purchase of Xillinx As others have pointed out PE alone is a pretty terrible metric to base investment analysis on when taken in isolation You are missing the xilinx merger About one month ago it looked like this The stock market is trading future expectations and AMD has delivered strong growth in revenue the last years httpsstockanalysiscomstocksamdfinancials The trailing PE ratio is 118955 and the forward PE ratio is 3931 AMD has completed its 49 billion acquisition of Xilinx A look at their latest numbers In the fourth quarter of their 2022 fiscal year Xilinx generated 600 million US dollars in revenue the only quarter to be reported by AMD as a separate entity before the companys operations were incorporated into other AMD business segments A look at their past reports shows that there is a potential of a 1000 million quarterly profit httpswwwstatistacomstatistics1184120xilinxquarterlyrevenueworldwide With a forward PE below 40 AMD is certainly not a bargain but regarding the outlook not expensive either in my opinion Isnt AMD extremely overpriced am I missing something Thats literally what people asked when Nvidia shot up before their big AI earnings I dont know personally but just saying To me PE is just a starting point and others have offered excellent explanations here For a rapidly growing company like AMD I prefer to use forward PEG Price to Earnings Growth ratio which I believe gives a better benchmark to the valuation of a prospective company Look closely at the financials ROIC ROE cash versus longterm debt margins cash flow growth I welcome everyonethoughts in response Thanks You not wrong in the sense that AMD is not cheap But a lot people tend to overreact to one quarterly report For all the hubbub AMD is only down 2 today If they put together a series of bad quarters thatmore concerning Valuationwise one can always slow down their DCA rate Considering the blood on the streets today amd didntank as much as I feared it would  PE isnthe end all be all It was all just hype after all It was a hollow performance with no substance Will the guidance be downward The revenues are disappointingly low,-4

2024-02-02,"An hour long Interview with TSMC!!!!! I'm thrilled to share that I've secured an interview opportunity with TSMC! As a chemical engineer set to graduate this summer, this is a huge step for me, and I'm keen to make the most of it. I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to prepare for this interview. Specifically, if anyone has insights into TSMC's interview process, the kind of questions they tend to ask, or any tips on what they look for in candidates, it would be incredibly helpful. Also, if there are any current or former TSMC employees here, your firsthand experiences would be invaluable to me. I'm all ears for any suggestions on technical preparation, questions to anticipate, or even the company culture. Thanks in advance for your help! Dont be youself. Be the person they want, not yourself.  Hiring Manager kept going back to one particular question - why do I specifically want to work in a ""factory setting"" rather than just chip design . Other than this, it's just going to be like any other interview - them asking about your previous experiences/courses you have taken/research you have done . In a nutshell, I'd say just relax and try to answer the questions honestly. Cheers and good luck! I interviewed and received an offer from them a few months ago. They asked a few STAR based questions so have answers prepared for some of the typical STAR questions. They also threw in a couple brain teasers which I answered probably 50% right: They asked if you have a 10 x 10 x 10 cube made up of 1 x 1 x 1 smaller cubes. The outside of the larger cube is completely painted red. On how many of the smaller cubes is there any red paint? They also asked what is the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100, and walk me through your thought process. They asked the classic, three switches outside a room control three light bulbs inside a room, you can?셳 peek inside with the switches on, but you can flip the switches on then back off, and then enter the room. How do you determine which switch belongs to which lightbulb? They were super laid back, good group of people, just be relaxed and make sure you understand the role and understand what TSMC does. Have some thoughtful questions prepared. I know nothing to answer your questions other than don?셳 stress too much over the interview process. But congratulations! It turns out that I'll be interviewed by 9 people at TSMC! The thought alone is quite overwhelming. I just quit feel free to DM me about culture etc; I?셪l try to provide as objective a perspective as possible. As far as interview, I?셫 not sure I?셝 be a good resource since their process has changed immensely since I joined, but am still willing to give my two cents I?셫 a supplier. Is the culture as aggressive internally as it is with their suppliers? Be yourself! This post appears to be about interview advice. If so, please check out this guide. I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns. Orange Pi Neo is new PC handheld powered by AMD Excellent. There can???be enough handhelds on the market. The more, the better. Handhelds are back on the rise again since the Switch re梨쫚vigorated the interest into them. Phones where about to take over the handheld market as after the DS succes it went into slow decline. Happy to see the development of this. The more successful the market, the more games that will prioritize the specs. Trackpads at least no gpio pins? smh why call it a pi then? i want a steamdeck i can customize with a methane leak detector I always wanted a geiger counter on my steam deck The company???name is Orange Pi. Make the shell orange or no deal That's for the limited edition. Now I wonder about bananaPi I???glad people have more options but it???hard to justify buying one of these other brands over steam deck due to community and developer support.",4

2024-02-05,"Do you think NVDA will split its stock soon? The last time they split it was in the mid $700/share ($748 I think), which it is rapidly approaching again. I know it has no real effect on the value of the company, but splits do often provide a nice bump to the stock price. Not that it needs the help going up... What say you? Split or no? If split, what do you think, 3/1, 4/1, something else? Perfect time to announce it would be during ER call Jul 20, 2021 4:1 Stock Split
Sep 11, 2007 3:2 Stock Split
Apr 07, 2006 2:1 Stock Split
Sep 12, 2001 2:1 Stock Split
Jun 27, 2000 2:1 Stock Split How does a 3:2 stock split work if you only have a single share? I'd love to see a split just so that I can trade options more easily  Not till $1000 plus They can split it however they want as long as it goes up to me  There's going to be some smoking high news about splitting on April 20 . Just stay mellow and don't get too puffed up about it . With so many stakeholders involved, there are some sticky issues they need to hash out first . not american, but what does some smoking high news mean? I will buy calls if they do. I think the only factor that still persists is the perceived value of a split to newer retail investors. It feels different for some people to buy 100 shares at $100 versus 25 shares at $400. More shareholders who are excited for my stock, the better all around. And to answer your question, I?셫 guessing 3/1 For now it seems like NVIDIA is not a good buy If AMD releases a product that outshines Nvidia the stock price could skyrocket Whether its Nvidia or AMD the growth prospects for this year look very promising so Im letting go of Nvidia and leaning towards AMD If I had bought this when I first bought Tesla You wouldnt be in such distress now New report says both TSMC and Samsung plan to keep manufacturing their most advanced 2nm processes in their home countries (Taiwan and Korea) Well.. duh. Why add unnecessary risk to your flagship product? Much less risk putting a fab on an older node in another country as an act of political goodwill. Looks like Intel will be the only cutting edge fab on American soil.  Honestly, so much research is done here and that?셲 what really matters. I thought this was already know? TSMC keeping their most leading edge node in Taiwan, and only moving other nodes abroad once they've been replaced was, I thought, already confirmed? Some rumors were claiming that also USA and Japan could have hosted 2nm fabs, example: A Japan-U.S. agreement is set to launch a domestic manufacturing base for 2nm semiconductors between 2025-27 for cutting edge smartphones+ - Patently Apple They have to keep that node hostage, so the US and other countries will defend them... Just in case you know what.  If the war started today losing Taiwan would cripple the world's economy . But if it happens in 3+ years it wont be as bad (still bad tho) as everyone is ramping up volume . China is heavily expanding on legacy node capacity . Intel and Samsung (and TSMC) are expanding more leading edge capacity .  This isn't a political move or some kind of nationalism/hostage kind of stuff . TSMC and Samsung have so much infrastructure set up at home, it makes no sense to be doing leading edge stuff continents away . It's like being shocked a chef chooses to develop their newest dish in their main restaurant back home instead of the outpost burger shop I for one am shocked that countries would want to keep their crown jewels in their borders. Also, all the existing talent already live in South Korea and Taiwan not worried. intel 18a, 20a and intel 4 seems to be going as planned Shock, TSMC will make 2nm in there Fabs New's at 10. We?셪l see. If Intel?셲 20A launches on track this year for Arrow Lake, I have good faith in Intel?셲 ability to be at worst produce a node that is between N2 and N3P with 18A. Meteor Lake delivers on the Intel 4 process node and has nearly twice the transistor density albeit not clocking higher. But it launched late by a month or two. Hopefully that doesn?셳 happen with 20A/18A so the theres atleast some domestic supply for the US in regard to high end nodes. US has not giving the promised Chip Act incentive. North America. If there was ever an investing thesis for $INTC. This would be it. I mean it protects their margins from increased labor costs TSMC is now the world's largest semiconductor maker by revenue, beating Intel and Samsung: Analyst Plus it's been a huge advantage competitive advantage for TSMC that they are an integral part of Taiwan's national defense plan: ""the better our company does, the lower the chance of an invasion"" is a pretty compelling sales pitch when seeking public investment. That explains why they are moving their fabs outside of Taiwan, totally makes sense. /s They are the leading fab because they are superior systems integrator, despite competitors accessing the same exact EUV equipment from ASML, TSMC is simply superior at systems integration. The US gov't and South Korea gov't have deeper subsidy pockets than Taiwan gov't, but you can't throw money at the problem. The massive cost of entry for fabs means the industry is ripe for monopolies and rich-get-richer practices that squeeze out competition No, they just offered a better product/service. That's all there is to it. Intel and Samsung are paying for their own failures. Samsung continues to sink like the Titanic... Samsung literally own south korea Double?! The next one who falls victim to marketing? It's speaking about wafer-revenue, not output.  Intel is only within the top ranks, since their wafers' products (read: CPUs) are sold at hundreds of dollars/sku . Others like TSMC, Samsung, GloFo, UMC or others sell their products at single-digit prices . Intel is an also-ran on everything else .  Intel isn't even in the top 10 since years when it comes to capacity, and Intel can't even remotely replace TSMC's or Samsung's capacity . Samsung alone had an installed 200mm-equivalent capacity of over 3 million in December 2022 . Overall, the annual capacity of the manufacturing facilities managed by TSMC and its subsidiaries exceeded 16 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2023 (TSMC's own website) Meanwhile, Intel produces only 884K wafers/month, which doesn't even qualify for the Top 10.
Also, even Chinese UMC is almost as large as Intel with 772K wafers/month. That's why it stung so hard when Intel got denied the Tower Semi-acquisition, as Tower at least held the last place in the world's wafer capacity leaders Top 10 and with that, Intel proudly shouted preemptively to be 'back under the world's ten biggest fabs'. Just crowed too soon, as obvious as it gets .. Source:
Top 5 wafer capacity leaders raise their global share to 54%
Samsung, Micron and Hynix account for 76% of leading edge capacity
Worldwide Wafer Capacity Leaders Pardon my lengthy reply but it's annoying when people pretend Intel has a bearing with the world's biggest and how it gets repeated over and over again that Intel is so big and has oh so much capacity, when it just isn't since years. Technically correct but not very musical I am not musically inclined, but I have this.Drop 2 coal in the chests in each chest that is the return. Put one steal plate to start the machine. I did not fix the problem with the return coal getting out of sync. Blueprint in a follow up comment. Edit: It did not attach the video
Second try,.. Here is the blueprint. This is really great Amazing. With more than one line you can also do chords. I know what I will build tomorrow!!Thanks for the inspiration!! This kid is strange It always falls after hitting 180 Im really curious about the reason Please let the experts explain",2
2024-02-06,"AMD CTO is here Hey guys I introduced Mark Papermaster to this subreddit today He said he will check it out He was very kind and nice We are very much like the new Homebrew Computing club What questions and requests do you have for Mark Disclaimer Inot associated with him in any way Just met him at a conference and pitched my startup which he was impressed by AMD AMD if you listen Give us huge VRAMs and your GPUs will fly off the shelves Just fucking double it and let invidia die in their 24GB only for consumers They WILL fly off the shelf but NOT because of the consumer Nvidia uses VRAM as a way to effectively control for the enterprise usage of consumer hardware so that they can have enormous margins and utterly gouge the enterprise market on GPU workloads The value is awful for A100s and H100s And everyone takes it because they have to A midmarket performance high VRAM offering would not only make everyones day in this wonderful niche community but also drive massive adoption in enterprise and hyperscalers The market doesnt want the current monopoly on training nor inference workloads Contingent on the above vision is also that tensorflow pytorch and a distant third amx need to work comparably with AMD hardware Its clear that AWS doesnt want this monopoly as well The g4ad instances with the pro v520 is ample proof of this But enterprise cant shift inference load without all the software frameworks working right now And a hurdle still remains there Its not as easy as pulling a pre made UbuntuNvidiaCuda instance that just works off of Docker Thats where yall need to focus Edit You know my viewpoint is slightly dated because I should give Apple more credit in absolutely trying to eat everyones lunch with the M series support and specs And thats clearly working too Look how many people in this community consider the Mac Pro route for a home rig This could spill over to enterprise with ease too although I dont see it credibly anywhere Yet And even that is somewhat not entirely their fault with tensorflow only starting proper non emulated support for apple silicon arguably with 214 possibly less than a year ago NVIDIA has been on 24GB as the top consumer card for 3 generations TITAN RTX RTX 3090Ti RTX 4090 and it sadly looks like the 5090 will still be 24GB A 2000 7900 XTX with 48GB of VRAM would be amazing and sell so fast Also AMD if you listen Please prioritize your compute software ecosystem Make PyTorch work out of the box without bugs make all the LLM tools work flawlessly Hire some competent new developers and let them work all day on improving ML open source support for your GPUs This would pay dividends 10 fold A consumer VRAM card with 96192GB ram made especially for inference is what everyone wants now It doesnt have to have supercomputer class performance Allocate more resources to rocm and fix bitsandbytes AMD Yes make sure that all the LLM loaders have support engineers who can help implement RocM support that is on par with the Cuda implementations AMDs lackluster rocm support is why I simply cannot buy anything but nvidia anymore This is coming from a guy that was 100 set to get a amd gpu before he got into AIML Give us an option that gives us VRAM and the community will rally around you Seriously dont give this opportunity to Apple alone I can run CUDA software on basically any Nvidia card they sell but even with the ROCm officially supported 7900 XTX cards I cant run bitsandbytes  httpsgithubcomTimDettmersbitsandbytesissues107 and therefore no unsloth as well Flash Attention

WhisperX httpsgithubcommbainwhisperXissues566 AMD does not offer any CDNA boards for ML startups developers researchers or enthusiasts If the plan is to gain developer market share and get production adoption maybe AMD should focus on providing some sort of path whether RDNA or CDNA for someone to be able to userun software locally It seems like for many of the most important open source projects AMD should be making direct upstream engineering contributions and for the rest they should be reaching out and otherwise simply donating GPUs for developers to encourage porting and optimization Yes as others said If you want AMD to explode in AI world sell affordable 40GB48GB 7900s Thats it Literally just let OEMs resticker the W7900 Sell it for a small markup over the 20GB24GB 7900 I will have one before you can even blink and would addfix rocm support in various repos myself If you give us a 96GB VRAM card with no video outs and some LHRlike restrictions to keep it away from miners gamers and data center users dozens of us will happily give you 4000 Whatever you think will keep it from impacting your other segments Id even rent it This is not practical without changing the 7900s memory controller die Its not impossible but not something Mark could make happen this gen even if he wanted to When you ask for changes in silicon you are asking for something years in advance Now AMD could release 48GB GPUs almost immediately That requires no silicon changes it doesnt even require a new PCB as they already have the W7900 AMD you should seed GPUs to people who develop open source projects Too often I see a main developer of a significant LLM project say something like I cant test this on AMD GPU as I only have a 3090 or I cant test multiGPU I only have one PS No Im not one of the developers myself and I have an Nvidia GPU I just would love to see AMD or Intel GPUs as a viable alternative when the next gen launches I would love if AMD had an answer to NVIDIAs TITAN GPUs something around 2K with 48GB of VRAM that isnt too expensive like the Radeon PRO W7900 People would be buying them up like hotcakes and there would be much more interest in AMD support for MLAI GPU with user upgradeable VramLPCAMM Mark the primary reason AMDs GPUs are not recommended in the Kobold community is because of the missing compute support in the drivers that could have worked just fine Only a handful of cards have support on Windows on Linux most of the 6000 series works fine but only after you manually set a workaround variable We had to program this in our software to trick the driver into thinking they own a different GPU I totally get the team may not have the resources to properly provide enterprise class support but every single customer who happens to have the wrong GPU we currently have to tell that AMD didnt care about providing the libraries needed and before we had our Vulkan build most of them were then left with nothing or at most a choice to install Linux and do a difficult For complete Linux beginners ROCm installation If you want AMD to succeed here all the team needs to do is release the TensileLibrary files for the remaining GPUs on Windows so projects can adopt them And all they need to do is mark every working GPU as compatible in the Linux driver even if that comes with a disclaimer that it is not officially supported for production use on that particular GPU Of course you will also have to deal with libraries and projects not supporting AMD but having proper ROCm support in your drivers for all GPUs is essential here Because those who see every Nvidia user be able to run the code because even the weakest GPU has CUDA compatibility of some sort now regret buying AMD and are considering Nvidia the next time round That can be reversed when support improves With this change it would make more people now be able to use the AMD compute stack and hopefully this lowers the barrier of adoption for projects like Pytorch which many depend upon that currently do not support Windows yet A lot of folks here are focusing consumer side which is great I agree that a raw vram boost just makes everyones lives better But I also want to mention from the biz side We chose NVIDIA over AMD because our impression of running them in a K8s cluster seemed to be easier based on the body of knowledge and reviews out there And the integration with all of the libraries has been working well for us To me the problem starts with the developers AMD could shift the focus by doing a venture wing with fledging AI companies and boosting their internal developer staff on a frictionless experience nvidia drivers can be annoying Get those two teams in a feedback loop AI companies complain about operation X Y Z  AMD internal devs focus full effort on that I think it also requires a more liberated employee experience for that team where theyre empowered to just build and chase value Nvidias valuation is ridiculous but right now they sell you the shovel and the maps to where to dig The hardware  lib situation is moving rapidly and its very hard to keep track of performance for different configurations of hardware x inference libs x models AMD would be doing itself and the community a huge service if they contributed somehow to this matrix of what is supported what is the performance and any code that helps to run their hardware with said libs Step 1 Unfuck rocm  actually support all your recent GPUs fully on both linux and windows Step 2 Work with the llamacpp folks and exllama and axolotl and qlora etc to properly integrate rocm and optimize inferencingtraining using your API Step 3 Sit back and watch your highVRAM cards fly off the shelves Thats is Thats all you have to do The only reason nvidia is eating your lunch is because rocm is such a shitshow that its impossible to recommend AMD cards for LLM usage Nvidia sucks but cuda just works Make your shit just work and you win As expected Should I invest in a leading stock

Brings me from 45-55 fps in New Atlantis to 80+ on my 5600 and 6700XT. Looks smoother and the latency difference isn't too bad. This patch is also fixing some formid issues. I'm thinking mod tools are not far off. I still can't belive that I can craft a railgun barrel and scope from scrap but can't make ammo for my 1000year old handgun. This game is in a needs for a propper DLC. More handcrafted worlds and not the same planets wth same bs bases. Traditional dungeon style missions. More NPCs. A viable pirate faction that isn't shit. Better crafting. A survival mode. The list goes on. Fallout 4 didn't get ammo crafting until the DLCs, and every single recipe in it involves using literal shit as a crafting ingredient. Deliberate? Yeah, so anyways, I've got this knot in my neck that I really need to get checked out. My cat has been much better about the new home too. Glad she settled in.

Mr. Brace will serve as a member of the Compensation, Nomination and Governance Committee of the Board. Mr. Brace added, ?쏧'm excited to join the BlackBerry Board of Directors at such a pivotal time in the Company?셲 history. BlackBerry?셲 technology and market position provides significant opportunities to help enhance value for our customers and shareholders.""  Mr. Brace has an extensive background in the IoT, semiconductor, server and storage industries . His roles over the past 3 decades include a wide array of functions, including software, hardware, engineering, marketing, and sales . He led the company through operational improvements that increased profits by more than 100 percent . Mr. Brace holds a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo and a Master?셲 degree in Electrical Engineering from California State University, Sacramento. He has also participated in the Stanford University Directors??Consortium. Mr. Brace is also a member of the Board of Directors at Lantronix Inc. and Inseego Corp.  Prem Watsa has decided to resign from the BlackBerry Board of Directors as of February 15, 2024, in connection with the Company?셲 repayment at maturity of its $150 million principal amount convertible debentures held by affiliates of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited . ?쏝lackBerry and its Board thanks Prem for his many years of support and contributions to the company. We have seen enormous change in our business during Prem?셲 time on the Board and are appreciative of all that he has done to help with those achievements,??said Mr. Lynch. According to CNBC interview this morning Fairfax Holdings is being targeted by Muddy Waters. MW claims Fairfax of over stating book value by 30%, lack of corporate governance and oversight by auditor, PWC. MW has taken a significant short position. Glad to see him go!! Well well well. I predict a long drawn out legal battle for Fairfax and PW. Shenanigans, always shenanigans. The Prem Watsa and John Chen show are officially over. Long live Blackberry free from further shenanigans. Wow, just searched Fairfax and came up with all kinds of investigations for overstating value and weaponized short sales but this says it's Cohens hedge fund? Is it the same as PW Fairfax? There should be a time frame for a former board member being able to attempt a takeover. The guy has been on the board for years and could have been wielding power to drive the price down for his plan of a takeover. I?셪l bet all those charges go away if they get whatever they want from Prem Watsa. Question is, what do they need from PW? Holy shit, this sounds like a positive move in the right direction!  I think ivy does give BB a competitive edge and as an example payment processing with the car directly through Car IQ is worth the risk alone . I'm painfully aware our net income is brutally in the red and we don't have a lot of runway left but so was AMD's 10 years ago and people laughed at their bulldozer line up . From this and dattels resigning, What's going on......... Really like the addition of Mr.Brace! It sounds like we are not going bankrupt and there is no take over in sight.. dear lord how many years? Because I ain?셳 selling, I?셪l ride it to 0 ?쏝lackBerry?셲 vision is clear - to secure a connected future you can trust.??$ON Didn't someone state earlier that a hostal takeover would require PW to first resign from the board? Does this increase the risk? I dont want to fud or anything. Im just too smooth brained and asking question Not that I know either, so my conjecture -- I don't think it makes BB's future more precarious. Prem will keep his many BB shares and can root for them to become worth something from the sideline. Unless, Prem finds himself in another legal-based situation, where he might need liquid funds available. But again, the less association BB has with him IMO is a great thing. Only thing I will say about a takeover is that I don?셳 see Amazon or Canada for that matter letting it happen. Amazon isn?셳 letting Ivy get bought out by just anyone. Now Amazon could buy BB. That has always been a risk imo. Not a world ender by any means but if your cost basis is still high you will lose out. Is the veritas name related or a coincendence? Veritas Veritas Capital https://www.veritascapital.com/ was the ""supposed"" takeover bid. Veritas Technologies https://www.veritas.com/en/ca is where Philip Brace was a VP. ""Veritas Technologies is a leader in multi-cloud data management."" Just a coincidence. Veritas capital and veritas technologies are not related entities. I don?셳 like coincidence. Day old fish. Not sure what to make of it yet. BB ready for the Apes I held SWIR until 2019, when I sold it and bought BB. After I sold it, the sp nearly tripled before the company was acquired by Semtech about a year ago. Going to 300 by yearend Stay strong How many shares of NVDA do you guys own Like what the title says. How many shares do you guys have at the price it is at now. 1,100 Almost all of it at $93. I?셫 single 0.21 ?ㄳ (I just started investing) I had 300 at $30 (PRE SPLIT) or so, I bought them in college using money from an internship. This was circa 2015 Recently, I?셶e loaded about an extra few thousand shares the past 3 years. Average is $300. Some before the split, some as recently as a few months ago. In total I guess I got well over 5000 shares after the splits and what not. The college era shares representing 2100 or so  99% of the people out there when they mention crypto or AI or ML, I know they?셱e full of shit and clueless . They have no idea what the basics are, why NVDA is valued at its current price, don?Â�� even know what CUDA is, can?Â� even tell me what Anyways I?셶e ignored the regards and it?셲 paid off. 3200+ --- 95% of shares purchased in 2017 - have not sold any shares since I opened the position Three. I keep waiting for it to go down to buy four more but it doesn?셳. I?셫 around 3264 @ $2.40 a piece. 5,000, started getting in at $32. I?셫 single 32 currently. Bought at $670. Better late than never Is NVDA worth it at this price or wait for drop? Is NVDA worth investing at this point?  NVDA up 12 points right now and seems to rise every day, but I just can't believe that this is going to last much longer . I have wanted to put money into it the last week and am now kicking myself that I didn??��. I don?Â³ want to wait until the stock splits and I don The day to get in was yesterday. The answer will be the same tomorrow :) Time in the market my friend ??agree 100% It might not drop much at all from here, maybe down $10-$20 from $700 then bounce back up but that?셲 it. It?셲 the leader in AI and EVERY major company buys from NVIDIA, there?셲 still plenty of growth.  I?셪l give you no numbers. I am not going to tell you which ones are going to succeed or fail . I think they are all pretty good companies, and if you bought a package of these stocks over the next three to four years, you would do very well . I hear this stuff all the time, about how Buy now. Earnings are coming up, and there's still an anticipated stock split. Got in at 450 when everyone was telling me not to. Now up $9000 lol So worth. Market leader and industry developer. Nvidia is to advanced computing as Amazon was to eCommerce. Buy if you believe in the long term. Don't mind the current price. Don't, if you want short term exit. It is always risky like any other stock.  If the quarterly report on Feb. 21 beats market expectations, we will surely see more strong interest and buyers . Trend is still upward IMHO but hold steady ?corrections are always possible too. Just buy more then if you still feel your own analysis justifies it . Edit: new high this afternoon > $702 I'm not buying anymore. Too close to retirement to back up the truck. I've been preaching this stock for 3 years. Just cannot buy anymore. Just now the afterhours trading price is at 887 Whats going on Can the market fall so sharply due to a bear market NVDA gap to 200 week moving average is unprecedented. Are we insane? Join WSB Discord Its almost like no one gives a shit about your crayons, post the loss pr0n. Its just numbers on a screen no one knows how to value anything. If it goes up we keep buying if it goes down we keep buying God speed This is the way NVDA to 800 end of March $800c for March 1st are $13.18, that's insane. They were $1.50 a week ago. Someone out there bought a bunch of $900c for March 1st for like 40 cents and has made 1,000% return this week. For a call that's still $200 OTM.  I bought at $295 and sold when it hit $150. I should buy back in now. Plenty of room left to run to a share price of $54,000 by March. I finally bought one single share. Sell now, things about to go south real fast. Longneck dinosaur pattern ?쫾 Next NVIDIA httpsmblognavercommoneyoungo223346501225 TSMC Allegedly Not Rushing into Adoption of High-NA EUV Machinery High-NA halves the maximum mask size. This is okay if you're Intel, which is obviously moving towards a tile-based system for both client and server and is unlikely to be producing die exceeding the ~410mm2 mask limit, but TSMC has to cater to much broader clientele. TSMC has a whale customer in Apple's iPhone division and another massive customer in AMD's CPU division. They could justify a node that can only make small chips if they needed to. I don't see why that would be a bigger problem for TSMC vs Intel. Intel produces disproportionately large dies compared to what TSMC typically deals with. Nor is the move to chiplets an Intel-only thing. Also, reticle stitching is always an option. I would say it also is simply because TSMC has the installed capacity of existing EUV machines and want to monetize that. It is easier to work with what you know when the main benefit of High-NA is simply throughput. The cost savings are eaten up by not utilizing what you already have and to a large part amortized already. TSMC has the benefit of several nodes using essentially the same compatible EUV equipment by now. That means they can shuffle around capacity to an extent. That isn't possible if you start using other equipment and create a technological wall in implementation. I don't know how backwards compatible High-NA is for existing EUV implementations, but something tells me it's a no go without re-designs. This is similar to how Intel often used to operate in the past. With wanting to re-use as much equipment as possible. They converted some of their fabs back to 14nm from 10nm rather quickly, when the issues started since they needed the capacity for example. Someone from Intel mentioned that this approach was perhaps part of the 10nm problems. Since it meant they didn't utilize the latest generation of equipment and the best industry practices in all cases. Since their 10nm implementation had to be compatible with their existing 14nm DUV infrastructure. Rather than being a ""clean slate"" and building a fab and using equipment best suited for the node. This as always been TSMC approach. They have always been conservative (as far as foundries go) in their roadmap to make sure they deliver. This is the reason why 20 years ago nobody would guess the winner of the node race would be TSMC and the reason why today they are. Remains to be seen if history is going to repeat itself again or if intel is going to come on top.  TSMC early adopting EUV when Intel didnt that lead to TSMC producing better nodes . High-NA adoption wont nearly be as crucial, but TSMC sitting on the sidelines isnt a good thing for them, especially when supply is extremely limited .

Similar pattern can be seen on any chart where NVDA has declined or traded flat the previous day Institutional investors are not going to be buying anymore stock knowing a sharp correction is imminent 2 weeks out.

NVDA?셲 previous guidance is going to screw them at earnings as the market has expectations beyond anything they themselves broadcasted, which will lead to a correction down to the mid 600?셲 5. I bought calls for 680 expiring tomorrow Edit: it will hit 670s then rebound and trade flat around 680ish. Then next week will drop some more before spiking and crashing Join WSB Discord 5 was all you needed to convince us Inversed for those of us who are highly regarded and haven?셳 figured out how to order drinks yet So you just woke up this afternoon and decided to ruin everyone's night huh? Nvidia 1000 confirmed at earnings. !banbet NVDA 710 1d Ban Bet Created: u/Longjumping-Step3847 bet NVDA goes from 697.65 to 710.0 before 09-Feb-2024 07:43 PM EST Their record is 0 wins and 1 losses. Join WSB Discord this post will fuel the run to 745 tomorrow lol Man you buy puts at your own peril. Just own the stock or don?셳. This market is whack. Did you see arm today. That was wrong on so many levels. Those are reasonable points so 2k into 800call it is for earning. Ride the talking horse I currently hold 220 shares after selling many of them ARM saw a significant increase after hours so Im planning to take profits and reinvest in either ARM or AMD Technology stocks have been soaring too high so Ive been cashing out and shifting some to dividend stocks but seeing ARMs performance today made me consider jumping back on the bandwagon The age of artificial intelligence is on the horizon Hardware is also on the rise Why is this sub SLEEPING on TSMC?  Only downside I see is solar flares and war with china . I live in AZ and I can see the factory they are building from MILES away its huge . I have Pelosi level gainzzz from this stock . Join WSB Discord Warren was wrong on that one.He is rarely wrong.TSM is going higher. The government just came up with billions to help out the Az chip factory builders I'm from Taiwan. The ""invasion"" threat has been going on and been on the backburner for decades. When it comes down to it, it's all about business. The west happens to be very ignorant of the history of Taiwan and is exacerbating the decades long situation with igonrant chatter. TSM is hugely undervalued due to this ignorance. Does the factory look almost done? Do they say when it will be completed? idk but its real fuckin big I can see at least 150 it looks like it?셲 about to have a parabolic swing Risk of Chinese repatriation, trouble hiring for new U.S. fab, risk of not meeting yield at new Fab. Short term plays are fine, but I?셫 not holding anything long term It's sleeping even more on ASML. Most have never heard of them but TSMC, Samsung, Apple, Sony, Intel, AMD and NVIDIA are 100% dependent on this one Dutch tech company. We don?셳 want to upset China  TSMC is a good stock to own. They will continue to make good money for years to come. However this is wsb. Putting money in tsmc is like putting money in Foxconn when Apple is making bank . It has a large market cap compared to other options making it less likely to have a massive run up. It?셲 still a winner but I think there?셲 better options in this sector. SMCI for one. Yea but it beats earnings like a fucking lazy hooker and has a low p/e compared to everything else in the sector thats downstream from it. Chinese invasion is priced in All big jobs are shit shows Good company, bad government, worst location. China is planning to invade may Thats priced in",2
2024-02-09,"AMD 7000 Series Crash solution Not only does it improve framerates significantly compared to DX12 on this game, it seems to stop the crashing. I still highly recommend you use the rest of the guide to disable hyperthreading (SMT) as the CPU utilization is way too high, using Process Lasso will cut it in half and you won't lose any performance.  DX12 Fix: The game is using too much of the CPU . I saw up to 99% CPU usage on a 5800x3D which isn't???normal . Capping FPS to below 100 seemed to be a band aid fix as it kept it below 100% where it was crashing but still ran at about 95% .  You can do this by using a free program called 'Process Lasso' and right clicking the games exe on there and going to CPU Affinity > Always > Disable SMT . Make sure to set through 'Always' so you don't have to re-apply the changes every time you boot the game . I capped my framerate to 101fps using RTSS but can use AMD Chill to do this too - haven???crashed since. Please lower the framerate cap depending on the strength of your GPU, for reference I'm using a 7900XTX. If you have a 7800XT (just as an example) you should probably cap to 80fps. I also have Global Illumination turned off in the game and have my GPU capped at 2400mhz to stop GPU utilisation reaching 100% as it seems whenever the GPU/CPU spikes to 100% it crashes, note that it's hard to monitor these performance spikes because they happen the moment your game crashes to the desktop.  You can easily set up a max clock speed in AMD Adrenaline by going to Performance > Tuning > 'Custom' on the far right, then inputting the value . If you're still crashing try lower lighting quality to medium or lower your framerate cap . In-Game Graphics Settings: Screen Space Global Illumination - OFF Light Quality - Medium Motion Blur - OFF Depth of Field - OFF Sharpness - 0.90 Texture Quality - GPU Dependant Object Detail - High Render Distance - High Shadow Quality - Medium Particle Quality - High Reflection Quality - Medium Space Quality - High Ambient Occlusion - High Vegetation/Rubble - Medium Terrain Quality - High Volumetric Fog - Medium Volumetric Clouds - Medium Anti-Aliasing - ON Render Scale - Native Borderless Window VSync - OFF These settings are for a 7900XTX, if you have a weaker GPU, lower accordingly. Summary: Disable SMT (hyperthreading) using Process Lasso Add -use-d3d11 to Helldivers 2 Steam launch options Cap your framerate to 101fps (lower depending on the strength of your system) Disable Screen Space Global Illumination in game Set Lighting Quality to Medium in game Set your maximum GPU clock speed to 2400mhz (lower by 100mhz for each tier of GPU) https://preview.redd.it/xmtcozl9hphc1.png?width=2407&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b0512a9cf3e403d23bb02c34305a2bbcbae53c0 Thank you for this. It should be upvoted higher. It works as a temporary fix.
(5800x3d + 7900xtx here) Update: i've been playing ever since, no crashes so far I got the same hardware, I'll try now, fingers crossed Update: It worked for me! Was monitoring my CPU + GPU, their usage % is great now! As well as their temps You're welcome, pretty sad we have to go to these lengths but oh well, it's playable. First Mission with the Tool went smooth, big thank you for sharing your Solution. Before it started crashing at random points (didnt look at specif metrics/values) start/mid/end of a Mission. Now i can finally start purging Bugs while waiting AMD/AH works sth out <3 <3 *Worked for 4 Missions* Trying now to disable Global Illumination and cap the framerate too. AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core + XT 7900XT Yeah, cap the framerate, disable GI and lock your GPU mhz to like 2300 maybe since you??켩 on 7900xt Not all heroes wear capes. But helldivers do! Thank you sir ???$AMD GPU: Sapphire Nitro+ 7900XTX CPU: R7 7800X3D RAM: 323GB G.Skill X Flare 6000Mhz Expo  Got the game, and after an hour in I was unable to finish a single match . Tried 6 times, solo and co-op and it crashed every time somewhere in the middle of the mission . Once I downloaded Process Lasso and disabled the SMT, capped my FPS with Radeon Chill and capped my GPU to 2400MHz, and turned Have played several matches and so far so good. Now if only the Devs could've figured this shit out before release. Hopefully they patch in an official fix soon, but until then see you on the battlefield soldier. **1 day update: still crash free a day later and roughly 10 hours in. OP is the GOAT for this thread.  I had tried a few other things prior and the game would still crash, but after downloading the program you recommended and using it as you recommended I??턤 been able to complete multiple missions with no crashes since . I made a post in the discussions section on Steam linking people to this post . I just want to add for anyone else coming here desperate due to crashes, I'm on an i9-13900k/RTX 4090 and this solution worked for me. I have literally been unable to complete an entire match due to crashes since launch. What finally did it for me was disabling multithreading - see OP's instructions regarding Process Lasso.  I can actually see the moment where it is working - I start to freeze as I always have, but then instead of dropping to desktop like usual, it keeps me in the game and then unfreezes . The interesting part is that when this happens, we usually lose a member of the team .  I've spent so many hours tinkering and trying everything to get this game to work, and disabling multi-threading seems to have fixed it . I'd love to make sure that Intel/Nvidia users also see your post, b/c I think maybe it could save them as well . I also hope that Arrowhead sees this, 7800x3d/7900xtx, unfortunately didn't work for me Ah well, will wait till Arrowhead fix it I guess ASML's latest chipmaking machine, weighs as much as two Airbus A320s and costs $380 million Can you ELI5? What it is? What it does? And why is it so important? I wonder if most people realize how important a company ASML is? They are literally the only company in the world that can make EUV photolithography tools. No EUV means no latest generation of microprocessors. The common man only wants to know when will phones become cheaper. onerous wasteful aback weary rinse grab summer towering adjoining zealous This post was mass deleted and anonymized with Redact And ASML was co-founded by Philips. Another electronics company who was responsible for growing Eindhoven to the tech hub and university city it is today. And these days, ASML has a market cap of $375 billion compared to Philips' $17 billion. ASML is like the child that outgrew his parents. The Pringlenator 3000 Imagine dropping this thing off in 1930 People in 1930: what the fuck this thing do? Does it come in Black? It?셲 incredible that the entire world and the most valuable brands depends on this one single company to make cutting edge chips. Remember the HDD shortage because a single flood reduced the worldwide capacity for the production of magnets... It's not really just the one company, there's an entire economic ecosystem around them of smaller companies making very specialized things at extremely high precision. Even if ASML has established second sources for critical components in its supply chain, I figure even one or two of them disappearing would cause major problems for new litho machines. Just out of interest. Does anyone understand how you go about making a clean room like that? Like I know how they functionally operate, but how do they initially get that way? Like you start off with a factory, and then you'd have to get every spec out that you could? And then you build the clean environment inside that? Grab the air house and give it a bit of a blast out? /s How does it work? Positive air pressure and using big fans with HEPA filters until the particle count drops to zero. Building a cleanroom is relatively simple, especially if you have a new building. Just use the right materials and clean thuroughly after each step of the process. The tricky part is keeping it clean, which relies heavily on the discipline of its users and the cleaning staff. I recommend Asianometry (YouTube) to anyone that likes good video essays about lithography. Dude does a whole range of topics. Historical titles about China and Soviet Russia brought me to his channel through the algorithm, but the manufacturing of chips kept me around. I love that channel! Great deep dives on tech topics in particular. His ASML videos blow my mind. It's the coolest and most insane thing ever made. Hitting particles of liquid tin with a laser so it turns into a plasma to generate 13.5 nm light 50,000 times per second. The reticle stage moves up to 30 Gs of force. That would be a very weird choice for weight comparison. An airplane is built to be as light as possible... And it does not even say how much it weighs... So big it has it's own catwalk. A thing of art. In size terms, it is about the same as a printing press so it would need one. Only, a heck of a lot more complicated and a lot more regular maintenance. Edit: We were working on the system that would be used to test and measure the mirrors ASM would use for EUV lithography. EUV does not use lenses. Wait, so how much does one Airbus A320 weigh? And I what's that value in multiples of Shaq O'Neil's. But what does that equate to in chihuahuas? It's like we need a common standard of mass. One Airbus weighs about 1/10 the Library of Congress. Hope this helps. So glad I don't work there. Replacing a bad sensor in the depths of that thing must be hell! I?셫 a semiconductor equipment engineer in high-volume manufacturing. You fly in a team of people for two weeks to do it for you. I?셫 glad I?셫 not one of those guys. Just wait until you learn that it shoots flying molten metal with lasers. They are going to think you are joking but??I know you ain?셳. These things are astonishing. I work in ECD and plasmas in semiconductor HVM and as cool as my processes seem, they are nothing on EUV/DUV. it?셲 the truly magical stuff. ELI5: how does ASML chip making work ? I could not understand anything from what smart ppl say Have you seen those lasers engraving letters on random objects? This is basically the same, they use a laser to etch structures on a plate of metal. Except the plate of metal is really flat and the laser is very precise and it prints really really small, a lot smaller than a dust particle for example, which is why they do it in clean rooms because dust would ruin the print. What do those engravings on the thin metal do? I'm not too familiar with ASML particularly, but from what I was able to find they manufacture photolithograpy machines which are used in IC manufacturing. I'll say a few things about ICs in general and let me know if you still have questions:  Integrated circuits or ICs are one of our greatest inventions . This all comes down to how you can make a transistor from differently doped, contaminated, silicon . This transistor is an amplifier and can be easily used to mimic a resistor or a capacitor .  Silicon on its own has 4 valence electrons like carbon but we don't need a lot of energy to brake these bonds . Still silicon is a poor conductor so we introduce some free-ish charge carriers by doping the lattice with another atom that has 5 electrons so 1 electron can be moved easily . So the kind of circuit is determined by the  When it comes to ICs we specifically contaminate regions to n and p type . A fully n type silicon piece can be overcompensated with p type contamination . If we introduce 5 million extra electrons and 5 million holes we again have a lattice with 4 bonds around everywhere .  Photolithograpy is a way of transferring a pattern onto an optical mask . And making the proper mask is a big thing fundamentally this decides what the circuit is .  Lattices often have defects like dislocations, a layer of atoms which doesn't streach the whole lattice and distorts it . The requirement is to not have more than 1 dislocation per cubic meter of lattice .  The first transistors were yay big like the size of your fist and had to be cooled in liquid nitrogen . The bonds of silicon can easily be broken, as you increase temperature more bonds break, which increase conductivity . This is why research is being done on alternatives like diamond . Semiconductor technology is cools and there are most likely a bakers dozen YouTube videos explaining how the doping works and how you can make a diode or a transistor. If you are interested in manufacturing things here is a bit more reading: https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/global/en/knowledge/semiconductor/room/manufacturing/process.html I hope this was informative enough and let me know if I still left questions unanswered. I have even more questions now but I should start by crossing one bridge at a time. Thank so much for this explanation thanks that was a good refresher  ASML makes this ""projector"" and their top of the line model is used to make high end chips . Because there is so much technology and R&D involved in this equipment it costs hundreds of millions of dollars each . Only ASML knows how to make and run the equipment . There is a lot of other manufacturing technology required so it isn't just ASML. There are other methods that might not need the top of the line ASML equipment either. Tons of other equipment and knowhow is needed to make high end chips. So it is a vast oversimplification to focus only on ASML. Where can I learn more about this From NVIDIA Goodbye and thank you for your hard work in shaping up all this time Look at your character Do you really have to write such posts here NVDA options Just simply venting. My portfolio is doing fine and I?셫 sticking to rules. Saw NVDA today and thought let me ?쐅amble??and break my rules. Bought a put hoping for a small drop but this thing keeps climbing. Anyone playing puts on this. So much hopium in this position with retailer traders it seems like they will buy at any level. This market is just fading up. Very strong bull wave right now. No reasons to short or time any tops. Just trade with trend or sit cash. IMO ?몟?뤌 Tried puts once on Nvda. Never again lol If your entire reasoning for buying puts on Nvidia, or any stock for that matter, is that it?셲 been going up and you FEEL it should go down I can tell you right now you?셪l have more fun with that money in Las Vegas. Are we sure it?셲 retail traders and not the big idiots driving it up bc they can?셳 face the question from clients ?쐗hy weren?셳 we in NVDA???$NVDA Agreed it?셪l pop at some point but I?셫 not sure I?셝 blame the little guys for the FOMO at this point I promise you it?셲 not retail moving NVDA by billions every week moving NVDA by billions every week you mean billions per day NVDA is solidly in 'buy every dip"" mode. I don't short into strength like that. People who buy puts are getting crushed, don?셳 fight the wave. You?셱e gonna have to wait until at least another week and some, probably until after earnings. Puts and NVDA dont belong in same sentence The trend is your friend, play it into earnings NVDA will fall on Monday to 700 because We are facing resistance at 720 which signals a retracing with the decreasing volume. This has historically always been followed by a fall of 1-3% Anytime the stock has soared 15-20$ it is followed by a sideways movement in the market followed by a drop. Since institutional investors are aware we know this, they will sell off a day early on Monday instead of Tuesday There?셲 no more catalysts coming up. Today?셲 boom was brought on by the announcement of their custom chip segment which is now already priced in. They cannot have any more surprises ahead of earnings without risking a boost in price beyond analyst forecasts which causes their price to crater Institutional investors saw my last post listing a decrease in price and bought in droves to drive out what they perceive as the majority of WSB investors. Since the OG meme stock they have been scared of us and actively use the sentiment in our posts to bet against us. It had over 500k impressions meaning it was definitely on their radar  NVDA earnings will be nowhere close to the expectations of the guidance given by NVDA, and institutional investors know this . As such the usual approach where buying options 2 weeks ahead of earnings to capitalize on volatility is moot . It?Å� a race against time to see which big player sells first while they try to maximize their gains . Once I bought calls expiring 2/16 at $690 I want to double down on institutional investors being aware of this post. They will sell off/trade side ways to go against the trending posts in this sub Edit: my original post had 800k impressions Edit 2: after market is flat instead of gapping up which usually happens after a run up like this. Institutional investors are weary of this post and its implications Join WSB Discord Fall to 700 1 month ago: NVDA at 500 This is the signal that I wanted to cement my decision. I?셫 all in bitch Nvidia going up until earnings then maybe it will drop down. resistance in the stock market does not mean the stock is about to drop How could there be resistance at ATH lmao it's breaking a new ATH. What arbitrary resistance could be claimed up here? It's got the support of regards Says the same guy who said it was going to 670 today. Just give it a rest. OP is using Wendy?셲 WiFi to post this Wow regard yesterday you were predicting it to go to 680 but it fucked you hard and went to 720 today. $800 confirmed Pffft. $800 is for noobs. $1000 is the new $800.

2024-02-12," Micron 203 litigation is Stayed until at least April (most likely much longer) !! Please read in it's GSOP, HAJ, BS (the three alias I do know of) posted on the NLST Reddit forum Let me help you with Doc 493 because it seems people are not comprehending what Judge Gilstrap just said. : r/NLST (reddit.com) OF COURSE he wants to HELP you !! Read the entire Doc 493 and not just his highlighted sections (not the first time he has highlighted only what he wants you to see) https://stocktwits.com/Stokd/message/561260726 this is even worse - Stokd's opinion is ""no big deal"" and Gilstrap is 'looking out for NLST' ?? !! No surprise that another Short Term trader bailed but it is only small comfort that so far the stock price has not crashed back below $1  I already got downvoted for bringing up valid questions against HAJ?셲 posts . It was a legitimate question and pointed out that judges do hold of rulings if another court/entity is already hearing it . which is what I posted on twits when someone asked the same question. Of course it matters...  HAJ kicked me off the big Reddit /NLST board years ago when it was jumping from $2 to $10 because I was constantly calling his BS as I saw it and destroying his make-believe understanding of law and patents both . LOL. LOL. I think I just now found this group for the first time (haven't looked  VHC federal court lawyers have accepted my call or returned my call within 24 hours . It's all documented on the Investor Village website (or at least publicly it was until FUDsters showed up and we created a private board).  Some really good people over on IV put big and small money in from $1-$5 and got out between $6-$10 and $6 again because I screamed ""Get out"" and they trusted me . Don't know if I'll be back, but I still check the NLST IV board every few days . As always, good luck to all!!  So out of curiosity one day I started to look at the profiles of the people that comment ???????nhanks HAJ???쐅o NLST??etc, those people have no real comment histories other than NLST . I feel like i fell for a Ponzi scheme now I???n???I? Imo the system is broken and might be a little corrupt. I have been a holder for years abd I only hope that NLST can survive financially. Time is against them. Btw. Got a order to purchase more at 1.15 price point. I keep loading up The PUMPer/Scalper tag team is at it again speculating about '203 litigation...and they are still just as wrong as they were a month ago when the Stay was put in place. https://stocktwits.com/Stokd/message/566654357  Discovery is done so NLST would have to request Supplemental discovery...which was already denied once so more time is not a benefit to NLST . IMO, the NLST expert has already extrapolated Micron's future revenue for the litigation time frame . Samsung's lawyers refer to NLST's contradictory positions regarding Settlement negotiations...if only we had the details !!! If we do not have the details pertaining to Sk-Hynix Settlement negotiations (or Samsung and Micron for that matter) then we have no way to know if this is BS or a valid argument !! https://stocktwits.com/Stokd/message/561883223 guarantee ??? yes, IMO, PUMPer/Scalper reeking of desperation to move the stock price. key word to not miss is SHOULD (used a few times including by Stokd) https://stocktwits.com/Stokd/message/566680277 Micron has no reason to provide data to NLST beyond what was required by Discovery (which was 2021, 2022, and only the first half of 2023 where there is little to no HBM sales) NLST expert is allowed to provide a lump sum payment amount but not a royalty rate !! That is extremely important for the long term revenue stream. more guessing on Judge Gilstrap's motives...hope springs eternal !! https://stocktwits.com/Stokd/message/561288068 NOT funny how he always admonishes everyone else to not speculate ! ask yourself this, so far NLST has appealed some PTAB FWDs but not all...DDR5 patents are in appeal to the Director, 608 IPR appeal to the Director was denied, 506,339 appeal denied if HBM patents are found by PTAB to be ""unpatentable"" then NLST will again appeal to the Director and the 203 litigation will be on Stay for a lot longer Discovery is done so NLST would have to request Supplemental discovery...which was already denied once so more time is not a benefit to NLST as far as Micron HBM/DDR5 revenue NLST revenue will hopefully have improved and hearing an improvement in Profit Margin (EPS will still be negative for 2024) will mean that NLST is selling more than just SK-Hynix and Samsung products.  REV will be up incrementally, EPS of course still negative . I'm hoping the increase in rev will drive the price up a dime or so so I can sell another 50k tomorrow . Gonna a long wait either way . IMO, the Special Master for the 293 seems to be angling for both sides to settle versus following the law...now we wait to see if Judge Gilstrap is thinking the same way ! Will either Micron or Samsung wish to settle anyway ? IMO, I think NOT !! I might get cancer Keep up the good work You must be really worried Let me help you with Doc 493 because it seems people are not comprehending what Judge Gilstrap just said. Judge Gilstrap stated during the Samsung Trial stated the validity of the 060 and 160 was unquestioned so I think we can assume that he really wants to know what the PTAB ALJ's will find.  He also tells us in his order that the stay is limited till ""April 12"" approx. So he is telling you the trial is moving forward regardless . So I think we can assume he's interested what the PTAB has to say but as far as his court is concerned he will move forward after .  The busiest Patent Judge and Magistrate and a Jury have been contradicted by a PTAB process . The court had expert witnesses in the trial and in the filings state their positions . District court uses a higher standard of evidence so this is just the Judge dotting his I's and crossing his T's . Thank you for being so thorough. Cheers! I really think the judges would learn for the parties to settle so they could clear this from their docket. I guess we will find out. I feel like Linus with Charlie Brown waiting on the Great Pumpkin to arrive No it's more like Lucy holding the football and then having it pulled out from you when you go to kick it. More like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football. Thanks as always! Thanks Shag, you hit the nail on the head! IMO Judge Gilstrap wants a written FWD from PTAB. Further evidence (if different from the SS 60/160 Willful Infringement rulings) of PTAB flaws. Perhaps the potential DC argument will support our appeal to CAFC (if necessary). I think Gilstrap will go head to head with PTAB sooner or later. Isn?셳 it typical for judges to adopt rulings from other courts/officals? The intent being they don?셳 need to hear an argument and make a decision if someone has already done so. In this instance if the PTAB shuts down NLST IPs then won?셳 the whole thing just get thrown out?  To me it seems like he must give some weight to the decisions or there would be no reason to wait until a decision is made on 160 and 60 . To me, TO ME, it makes sense if the IPR determines that they are unpatentable then at least the district judge will consider that in his decision . NVDA Options? Is anyone willing to touch NVDA with a 10-foot pole for their earnings next week? Their premiums are kind of disgusting right now, wondering if anyone else is thinking about opening some CCS?셲 like i am lol 2 quarters ago I got my ass absolutely handed to me with some $350 call credit spreads. So i have a little PTSD with nvda, but I did look at some $870 spreads for next week, seem to be paying some good premium for this risk. But there?셲 a chance this thing just makes a run straight for $1000 so who knows Nope. That tulip is still blooming. When it stops, you'll know. Don't sell puts near earnings. That's CSP 101 NVDA is a bubble? Here's what the science says... As you can see from this fine graphic, NVDA's free cash-flow per share (the Tony Montana of financial metrics) coincides with the exponential rise in stock price. For perspective, here are the free cash flows per share of NVDA and some AI contenders: NVDA = $7.10 AMD = $0.15 (bruh) INTEL = $-0.48 (lololololol) ARM = $0.65 As the chart shows, NVDA can out-invest and out-expand its competitors. It's scientifically proven. To put that in further perspective:  You could lay 77,153 hookers head to toe from Las Vegas to the Hoover Dam, drawing a mega line of cocaine 124 km long from slut #1 to slut #75,153 . Over the course of 62 days, the hookers would walk while snorting (continuously, because no one tells you how to live your life) That's how much CASH NVDA is pulling... Join WSB Discord Me: ?쁥oney I am investing all of our money into Nvidia??$NVDA Wife: ?쁶hat?셲 your reasoning behind it???$NVDA Me: ?쁮ver 70000 hookers and a 124 km cocaine line??$NVDA Wife: buy calls Hookers aren't sluts. Hookers charge. Wait was the hooker analogy supposed to make things clearer here bc I'm confused af this is too complicated. Im just going to keep throwing money at nvidia Step 1: find correlation Step 2: claim causation Step 3: profit So how much money do we make now Not sure if it counts as a setup but Upgrades for the future are: Rode Nt1 (currently using an At2020) Ergo mouse Ultrawide monitor Why wouldn't it count? I see a PC right there in the center of it all. Looks nice. Thanks man, the cables are a challange though, once i get enough money i'll try to get cables that are the right lenght your keycaps look weird The most basic laptop keycaps Good, a lot of space in that desk you can put a hella lot of pedals and external instruments Yeah i love this desk.

2024-02-13,"Is NVDA really over valued long term?  Apple hit an all time high of $56.44 on September 28, 2018, followed by a steep fall to high $30s in late 2018 . Time in the market beats timing the market . the risk is that current iterations of LLMs don't actually result in much real change in how people work and then people realize all the hardware they are buying is not going to be useful when we end up with something closer to AGI 20 years from now. seriously, for how much LLMs have been getting hyped up I haven't seen much in the way of material value. other than making porn and cheating in school. 40% of all companies on the stock market fail over a long enough time horizon. No one knows. There could be a bombshell report they are cooking the books next week or They could continue their growth most tech companies will make you money over the long term, but is the downside risk worth the potential upside at this price point? vs safer options for your money that will also offer gains  NVIDIA smells like Tesla right now, and it's due a correction . Sure they have a hold on AI, but that won't last forever and there will be a regression to the mean . The question is more about selling while you can if you own the stock than buying at those prices .  AI applications aren't looking to use video cards per se, they are looking for relatively cheap vector processors . Right now graphics cards are essentially the only game in town for those . If the AI boom has legs it will only be a matter of time before CPU manufacturers release CPUs with a lot more vector processing in them . The issue I see with it is that the product will be commoditized in the next few years as table stakes. Hardware is not the future, software is Insanely good margins woke up competition (AMD, INTL). Shortages of GPUs encouraged open source developers to adapt their libraries to the alternative hardware. Now NVDA has real competition. Is NVDA really over valued long term? No To keep things simple just wait for the fear/greed index to get to extreme fear and buy at those prices. Right now all big tech is overbought. NVDA dip buyers spotted Join WSB Discord i'm holding both calls and shares, got me scared a bit in the morning, but i decided to not look at it and take a huge shit. now everything is fine. I?셶e made a lot buying & selling NVDA calls. I bought a put a few weeks back. I immediately regretted it. It was a quick 5k loss in half a day. Would a call for 790 for march 8th be stupid I have $1000c for 3/8 average price $0.28??Current price is $5.00 No People bought $1100 calls for March 1 from me Lol I love how the whole market can crash, but Nvidia is still up today just like they are up every day. Everyone wants to own nvda. Every dip means the stock is on a sale. It's nuts. Or pure genius. Only time will tell. Realistic price prediction for NVDA after earnings So I?셫 seeing a lot of different numbers. Some say it will tank if results are anything short of phenomenal and some say it will climb to 850-900$ after earnings. So what?셲 the realistic range ? What do y?셙ll think? The entire US stock market is waiting for NVDA earnings. Even a 1 cent miss will send the stock down. But more importantly, if the guidance is lower, the stock will tank. But basically I think the demand is still there. Midterm, I think NVDA will continue it's raise. Yes, the guidance is very important, since NVDA's price is all about future earnings. Might be an exuberance than a fairly quick downward motion of stocks. I think NVDA will beat but the market overall has gone up so fast in the past 2 months, it seems like it?셲 at scary levels. But if it goes up good, if not and goes down hard, im sitting and waiting to buy If it beats by large margin, I?셪l say $850. If it beats by small margin, $700-750. If it meets expectations, then $650-$680 No chance it doesn?셳 meet Who knows. In Q3'23 earnings, they called for $20B in revenue in Q4'23. I am sure they will easily meet or surpass that, but the important thing will be their forecast. They already announced GH200 along with China specific chips so it will be interesting how they fit into their forecast for 2024. I would guess climb around $775-$800 at current price level. $800 I think I am waiting for the drop because I want to buy more to hold long term. on the same boat Same. However I bought 1 more share today. WS can do a rug pull at any moment no matter the fundamentals - even if it?셲 a beat, especially with a market at ATH. With everyone trying to secure their gain and the options frenzy that would generate it wouldn?셳 be pretty. The market is pretty nuts right now with Lift jumping 60% AH on a typo. I just don?셳 trust it. Why is NVIDIA doing this If businesses overlap they fight each other and profits decline",-2
2024-02-14,"NVDA earnings coming on february 21st. What do you expect from it ? NVDA earnings are due for the 21st of february. With all the current hype around AI in which NVDA and to a lesser extent AMD are under the spotlight I think it safe to say NVDA earnings will have an impact on the tech ecosystem. We saw SuperMicro (SMCI) doing almost too well for the past months following the NVDA trend. These kind of gains call for a pullback at some point. NVDA now being the 4th biggest capitalization. Feels a lot like TSLA hype back in the days. IMHO NVDA will post good results but not exceed to much expectations. We may have some slight red/flat days and then we'll be back in the green at the same rate until next earnings. So what do you expect from february 21st ? Start of a crash, flat or continuity in the green trend ? AMD didn't crash after INTC weak ER, nor did NVDA. In hindsight, Intel's weakness would have been a cautionary tale for AMD's reporting.  Intel is lagging behind everywhere, huge debt, pivoting and focusing more on its manufacturing side . AMD? It recovered a lot of its weakness after its reporting, and we are seeing more strength lately, more bullishness: It outperformed n Nvidia yesterday . AMD's weak guidance for Q1 didn't affect NVDA negatively . What does all this mean? I don't think NVDA has the capacity to derail an entire sector/industry. The world is bigger than Nvidia. I believe the August 2023-December 2023 range NVDA saw itself stuck into is coming earlier this year. I see flatness ahead, no more sloping. It will continue to grow, but it won't post a +200% year. Maybe +100%, maybe +150%. Total yearly return: 2 trillions, 2.5T. December 2024. Who knows? A fundamental story is not dependant on one player. Arguably, weakness at Microsoft, Google, META, Amazon and other software companies and datacenter/cloud providers would be far more concerning. Is there weakness in software? Servers? AI companies? I think they are doing well... ...AMD will do well. I?셶e pointed out the 4.5 mths of sideways movement just like you mentioned. It was an anomaly and seems to be pure hedgies manipulation so they can buy at low prices. Arrowhead Capital and Bridgewater seem to be the culprits. The past 6 weeks, NVDA has gone free Willy. I think hedgies will let it ride still so they can dump it later this year. Of course the GUIDANCE number is terribly important. A beat of 10-15% is expected Its hard to predict, earnings might be great, but stock might pull back. Im not selling AMD until an eventual chip slowdown (that might not come for years) I think that leading node fab capacity will be maxed out for years to come. Density is king IMO. I expect a split I'm not sure that increasing the accessibility of NVDA options is in their best interest at this specific point in time. I was expecting a stronger run up to ER this week....to 800 possibly. If so, then I would have said it will pull back regardless of the numbers they release. It's been stuck in the 700-750 range for a week so I dunno. It might be a coil spring, waiting for blowout ER to leap to the next range.  There is zero chance NVDA will post disappointing numbers . Analysts want to know if the demand is going to tapering out soon . If there are signs of tapering demand, the stock will crater to low 600s . The stock might respond lukewarm or it might go parabolic .  Jensen will likely tell us the early demand for H200 and GH100 are off the charts . He will not let this momentum die the way Mama Su always does in her ERs . I expect him to raise the TAM to 2 Trillion for AI . TL:DR NVDA will likely blow out the numbers and guide much higher for next Q but not sure what the stock will do. I have faith in leather man and will hold my shares.  By 2027 the AI TAM will be on the order of 5+ Trillion per year . The top 4 companies capturing that new business will be NVDA, AMD, Microsoft, and Broadcom . NVDA will probably be get the largest piece of that cake . I own literally zero shares of NVDA because I think AMD has more ground to cover compared to NVDA. by 2027? 5 trillion? From ~100B for 2024 to 5000B in 2027? 50x in 3 years? Have i completely missed something, or have people straight up gone insane on AI valuations?  The street is expecting them to have 70B+ of AI sales this year which would require them to hit their 20B guide for this quarter and do a couple billion better than that on average for the next 3 years . So if they guide flat to down for their first full quarter of this year then that 70B+. looks shaky . NVIDIAs entry into the ASIC business No matter how powerful Nvidia is breaking through the ecosystem established by BroadcomMarvel is not easy Network semiconductor technologies are highly concentrated in specific companies due to technology patents making it difficult for latecomers to catch up with leaders Apple also announced the development of its own chips WiFi Bluetooth chipset but ultimately failed due to lack of technology and patents renewing contracts with Broadcom Seems to be a bluff for negotiating lower prices In conclusion even if Nvidia enters this market it is expected to take at least 5 years to erode the market of existing companies During that period BroadcomMarvel will not remain idle In the short term it is unlikely to have any impact Stop with the nonsense Broadcom did not grow the company through technological development mostly through acquisitions Apple also mentioned development but they actually planned acquisitions Haha its like a Naver fan cafe commenting The companies Broadcom acquired are all infrastructure software securityrelated Symantec CA Tech VMware and completely different from ASIC right But if you knew that you wouldnt be commenting at this level Do some research before spouting nonsense about value investing or day trading without knowing the companies Nvda vs smci Why smci gets more gain?! Why is that? Which one is better and why? I?셪l keep it simple. Read it carefully. NVDA is better because of its long term potential and sales. They?셶e backed it up year after year and are on an insane run because of the AI craze and also because they have shown their potential. And are the priority in the AI sector.  Smci is crazy rn and if you got in even at 600 your profitable now because they have such a low float . The AI craze has driven the price no doubt but it will hold regardless of what the shorts say .  NVDA may even split in march SMCI in April . If you have the money buy both they will go up from here for the time being . Now if you wanna keep it safe ?ÂÂO NOT BUY ANY?? Okay now my opinion I have both NVDA since 400 and SMCI since 120 and I?셶e only added a couple since the bull rush but I constantly add calls for both. Wait for earnings if you wanna see a potential dip and buy then but I doubt either of these companies will fall substantially where it can be considered a must buy dip. SMCI gets more gains because of the low float and because of the increase in retail investors and the popularity in the AI sector. If you?셱e not experienced and do not have that much money to make a substantial purchase. Please be careful and only dip your toes. But if you have the money and have the time to do more research then by all means go ahead and buy both SMCI for gains for the short future and NVDA for the long term. I bought the first lot of SMCi at $90 last year. At that time, nobody felt like 12 times of forward PE was cheap, because it was a server maker. I traded several rounds, came to understand that the business was growing on the back of the AI infrastructure building, but the volatility was really high, I thought I might have misunderstood its risks. There were something I omitted but the market understood. Otherwise, it was difficult to understand why a growing server company didn't deserve even 18 times of PE. I got my largest and latest lot at $245 last year, and targeting 20 times of PE to sell. Coming into the new year, the stock was on fire, especially after the management made a very bullish full year outlook. Suddenly, 20 times of PE is no longer expensive, even 35 times of PE is not expensive either. I sold all the stocks at about $500, and trading around thereafter. I can't understand this. SMCI has a great business, but it is not ASML, Lam Research or NVDA. The entry barrier isn't that high. If it keeps this high margin, I think some competitors would emerge. But the market is always right. It is going all the way up to $1000.  The company's durable intellectual property (IP) has shifted its valuation from a basic P/E market multiple to one that merits a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation framework, similar to other high-growth entities . It?셲 the float- 90%+ of the stock is owned by institutions that can?셳 sell before mid march. Curious to see what happens when that gate is open nvda is going to run the ai industry which is on track to take over the world Have both in Option ?ㅿ툘  I personally sold all NVDA this morning (70% of portfolio) and went all in SMCI . I only started investing in SMci around late january, getting in at 550 . Since then i have sold and rebought multiple times, as i wasnt prepared for volatility of the stock . If you need to ask this question here you probably shouldnt be investing. Go to an index fund Smci is riskier with higher possible rate of return. Both will be around for a long long time Complimentary product, afaik. nvda has a highly established market cap. smci, perhaps in the early days? Hard to tell. the supply chain abilities can impact both significantly as it seems like demand exists. Oh really Why the correction is it an ant hole Shorting NVDA at 740 is literally free money at this point Why The expectation is that they greatly exceed earnings - so even if they do, the pop won't be anything insane, maybe 6-8% or so. That's probably what's going to happen. However. If they even slightly falter, then it's going to crater 10-15% at a minimum - I see 650 as a reasonable spot to exit honestly.  Investors only in it for the momentum (which has been waning the last few days), Google's chips, so many reasons for it to fall . SoFi feels like lambs being brought to slaughter .  I'm a software engineer at an AI startup and yeah I see the insane costs/demand for these but it's a hardware company and not software that can scale infinitely at no marginal cost . Now that I think about it, I really think I should've invested in it when I first saw that side of things but now I'm just doing it Positions (-20) NVDA @ 705 - 134% of that account, started on 02-06 200 NVD @ 8.95 fifteen minutes ago Other more reasonable choices Afterword Well in the time I wrote this it fell from 740 to 727 so never mind I guess, it's slightly less profitable of a trade but the point still stands (which is left as an exercise for the reader) Edit Edit 2 Closed NVD @ 9.27 Edit 3 Y'all - It is just money guys and here's the thing: I don't lose when it is worth more than my account (cause it already is). I lose when the losses are worth more than my account. Just going to hold through earnings, any losses are offset by the money market interest anyways Edit 4 NVD is 1.5x inverse NVDA. I did not close the NVDA lol Edit 5 My oh my the bullish comments have slowed down! What happened?!?  The price reflected something like a 99% chance of maintaining zero competition and continuing the insane growth for like a decade . That's true that's what it looks like now, and I feel like the underlying facts are going to change soon for its valuation . Also, I felt like that was the reverse sort of effect happening - only people buying at that level were shorts capitalizing and it's kind of like how we hit a super-bottom in 2022 from margin calls. Shorts have already *been* getting wrecked which is why it was a better entry at 740 than say 500. I can't even drink yet so stop trying to flex your buys from when I was in middle school lol Join WSB Discord People with NVDA gains: The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Oh my, you're gonna get cooked Have you SEEN the prices of puts?! Even two weeks out is like $4000 So between this post and the last one saying nvidia is going to 1,000 I?셫 not sure now who to inverse Pick one then inverse yourself. I?셫 no stock genius but you may want to leave that one alone lol. I remember a similar post at 380 Remember to do it with 10x leverage for even bigger profits! lol, Googles chips are like a generic bag of your local supermarkets' salted potato chips. Nvidia is Frito lays. Did you pay attention to Google's last earnings? OP said he?셲 doing it ?쐎ut of spite??because he missed the bull train! Although, it?셲 not the worst DD I?셶e seen here. NVDA only up, no gravity, only up I can stay irrational longer than NVDA can keep going up Just looking at Nvidia, AMD and Intel?셲 GPU product stacks for the next year shows there?셲 no other viable alternative in the market for high end AI chips for the foreseeable future. As long as AI has buzz I think Nvidia will as well. But I?셫 a moron, so there?셲 that too. But.... it's NVDA.... There was a guy in here who shorted NVDA shares heavy at like $510. Wonder what happened to him Dude, facebook placed an order for $10BB a month ago. There is no shortage for demand. They will crush and raise every quarter for the foreseeable future. $1000 it is. Think about this... all this demand is basically for *chat bots* - wait until computer vision starts to become more of a thing in 3-5 years, then we'll need another order of magnitude or 2 of compute power and a beastly NVIDIA chip for every car. Post a picture of you actually shorting NVDA and I'll give you the brass balls award. And I mean actual shorting, not buying puts. ??$NVDA",2

that it is We are at the end of our 80 year cycle which means it is time to capitulate The biggest players know theyre missing their cut from corporations just like governments are missing their cut from their biggest players tax evasion A top down initiative to in their eyes balance the books by being able to keep tabs on everything We got off the gold standard in the 70s and the wealth divide has grown exponentially because of it The central banks have been funding wars on both sides for centuries all as a cash grab For the longest time institutions say cryptobad mkay now theyre seething at the teeth for their piece of the pie 99999 of crypto predominately meme shit will cease to exist  if you lack utility you hold no purpose from a valuation perspective Bitcoin only holds the value it does today due to being the pioneer but it has zero utility  its a facade backed by being a finite resource ISO20022 was introduced in 2004 Basel 3 in 2010  both with regulatory deadlines against

revolution for this period of time web3 just as digital payments were web2 and credit cards web1 Rate of local and regional bank failures continues to escalate with bigger players picking up the remains and it has been on a constant decline since inception The amount of debt based fiat that has been injected into society in the past four years far exceeds any reasonable pace of inflation The cost and time to move money today is obsolete when doing it with crypto Upwards of 3 in fees and 15 business days to settle compared to pennies and seconds when crossborder transactions are performed Rate of institutional purchases of residential property especially in the US has seen a massive uptick Projections put institutional holdings of residential properties at 40 by 2030 Historic amounts of debt are being taken on by the average citizen along with the lowest savings holdings as well I would love everyones opinion on this regardless of the aforementioned points how could they My opinion Put the citizens in a place where the choice is obvious because there is no choice Weve all seen it from the WEF You will own nothing and like it Global Pandemic to take the temperature of such an event not remotely referencing a stance on vaccines Rock the boat on the supply chain to justify years of overinflated pricing 50 of inflation tied to Corporations unjustly inflating prices Print as much money as you can and allow massive grifts to go unchecked PPP loans Over 100 armed conflicts are in flight right now with the US doing what it does and fueling the ones where we to benefit from either from a military strategic standpoint or natural resources  were in active conflicts in south america middle east ukraine and africa So whats the domino I think itll be tied to Taiwan due to their semiconductor  microchip major exportation Someone country is going to cause escalation to focus in on Taiwan the US is going to say no sir and then BRICS think that the US is spread too thin militarily to counter them rapidly offloading US Treasuries in an attempt to crash the USD So lets say they do and for a moment were in an unheard of state of hyperinflation due to the dollar holding nearly no value and everything being overvalued  hello Venezuela Nigeria is already in this position having barred any cash withdrawals from government based accounts and restricting a weekly withdrawal rate for citizens  businesses Historically it starts in the East China Social Credit System  2009 and ends in the West  they are the test bed and upon acceptance it moves forward Perhaps we flounder for a bit but Uncle Sam comes forward with a solution to really save the day FedNow went live july last year and while theyve said repeatedly its not for CDBC they flaunt all of the proponents that make a CDBC  eg instant payments So what does the US put on the table that makes it irresistable aside from the fact it costs 300 to buy a gallon of milk Uncle Sam We care about our country and we want to get things back on track so all debts are forgiven and any money you have today will be there tomorrow  you just have to use our new currency system Theyll do this for the average citizen of which makes less than 80k a year I believe they will begin to tier the 11 compensation the more you owned in USD the less youll own in eUSD  effectively launching the wealth divide between people like BezosMusk and the Rothchilds even further Banks as you know them today will become subsidiaries of central banks and at best asset managers Now flame away its a conspiracy hypotheticals like this I find entertaining as hell Digital currency is the complete and total enslavement of mankind Full stop Well said Can I just say thatthis post takes me back to the glory days of this sub Well done OP  Hey thanks Fuck some political divide thats what they want from us Two words Bribery corruption There is no such thing as nation of freedom and no nation is Its all a load of dribble and slogans propaganda of illusion and mass manipulation of the imaginary of population s Erase everyones debt thats the real reset Then we can talk about digital currency Im game for all of the above just doubt those in power would observe that order Until the US gets rid of the federal reserve and goes back to coining its own currency whether digital or analog  theres no solution that doesnt end up as wage slavery We can use bottle caps for currency and have a healthy economy but not if those caps are loaned to the country with interest So a cbdc isnt any different than the current fiat currency as long as its controlled by a private institution not controlled by the government Sweden is a good example Its almost totally cashless Not by force ban cash but by making cash expensive They do everything with a smartphone app The trick is to make bringing cash to the bank very expensive Usually every company brings its cash to the bank at the end of the day If you have to pay a large fee for it you think twice So companies start not accepting cash anymore Its even safer for them Getting robbed in your store or on the way to the bank is a thing of the past Same goes for private people If I cant take my cash to the bank to pay my rent electricity heating etc I have no need for it right Another way to do it was shown predicted in the TV series Mr Robot The alternative currency promoted by a company gives you a discount for every purchase I think it was 10 less compared to the dollar price Banks of course will play a great role and they are working on it right now Reduce the amount of branches and reduce ATMs Make it as hard as possible to get cash Paying public transport with cash is no longer possible in sweden and many stores no longer accept cash anymore Supermarkets so far they accept cash but the vast majority of stores dont sweden is the clear example of agenda2030 even digital id has been introduced years ahead of the rest of the world and that is something most ppl dont know about it It always feels like they wave it in front of our face doesnt it Through the guise of an eager writer well condition the public to accept this concept With more exposure comes more desensitization If you are swede I dont know if you havent noticed but the phone company comviq forces using digital id bankid to log in their website Not only that if you wish to deposit cash into your bank account you will typically be required to explain where it came from If you cant provide a satisfying explanation they will refuse to take it On one hand the Swedish central bank Riksbanken claims to want to keep cash around but on the other hand the banks have to abide by legislation concerning money laundering and financing of terrorism giving them the perfect excuse to make dealing with larger amounts of cash as inconvenient as possible I see the value in cash but honestly using my debit card is so much more convenient Its very rare to see anyone paying with cash in Sweden anymore The only ones I see doing it are foreigners and old people Il add that in the Uk they did this by getting rid of banks in most small towns they made it harder and harder to have cash on you as it not that easy to find a cash machine that isn charging you 175 to taken your own cash out of a cash machine usually in poor areas You have cashless selfscan tills that don take money in small supermarket local shops Tesco express near me only the 2 tills that used to be 4 rolls take cash so this leads to be a big queue for scratch cards and everything else you need to buy from a proper till so I end up using contactless card payments to save time in a bit so big shop They tried saying Covid could live on money so a lot of businesses stopped taking cash like the buses that never have change on purpose and so they don get robbed As soon as Australia goes fully cashless the EU countries will follow suit and it then game over for all of us on here Walmart in the US has started retaining surveillance footage and running it through AI and face recog for years of small errors at self checkouts and only calling police once people hit a threshold Fuck this I am supposed to do an employees job and also be legally liable for mistakes Same way you force untested gene therapy upon themON The Fed has been saying very clearly for a generation We are going to make each dollar you earn worth less Each day you keep that dollar it will take another bite out of you until its worthless Yes a digital currency controlled by the state gives the state more control The response should be the same The more we feed the beast the hungrier it gets Starve the beast Reuse repair recycle Dont buy new buy used Start bartering and trading directly Yes its less efficient but each and every time we use govt fiat we are feeding the beast and the more we feed it the hungrier it gets The first hit will be free here take these free digital bucks and spend them Fiat has not been a store of value for over a generation During low interest rates debt backed by real estate has been an asset the debt has been more valuable than the real estate During climbing interest rates the debt will eat us alive one bite at a time Own what you consume Once you own enough you need other stores of value Fiat or digital currency is not a store of value Diversify Diversify Diversify Own businesses Own land Own ammunition Own beans Own rare or hard to find items When I buy nuts and bolts at the hardware store I buy some extra When I need a tool I buy it Now I have my own hardware store Learn new skills nobody can steal it It is indeed very difficult to live without feeding the beast We can still focus on starving it as much as possible Dont feed the beast In sweden we are pretty much cashless only supermarkets allow cash but most stores dont Digital ID has been around since 2015 and even broadband companies forcing clients to login in their services using digital id which is called bankid in sweden Its true that even with high taxes investing in the US is the shortcut to becoming rich It cannot be denied Txn unable to be found I trying to send USDT on ETH network from my Ledger wallet to my Phantom wallet Every time I try to send the transaction I get a orry the txn can not be foundmessage on etherscan Ie tried higher gas Ie tried using Zerion Ie tried clearing the cache and I unable to send anything from my Ledger wallet Yesterday I was able to send some ETH and when I went to send the USDT it just stopped working Anyone else experience this and maybe have a fix Connect Ledger to Metamask and do it from there Like connect my ledger to MetaMask and then send from the ledger in MetaMask to my phantom wallet Hmm my first thought is that Ledger Live is outdated  are you sure you are on v275 You can run into all sorts of sporadic problems trying to send from Ledger Live if it is outdated Not being able to send from MM might coincidentally be a separate issue You saying it fails instantly makes me think you have blind signing disabled within your Ethereum app on your Nano Is it possible you unintentionally flicked off blindsigning on your Nano device or maybe you recently updated firmware which will turn off blind signing by default The only thing that would tell us more info is your Ledger Live logs  but you dont want to attach those here You could open a ticket at supportledgercom and share your logs there Our ticket backlog is relatively low right now so we will get back to you pretty quickly Got my ticket open but yes everything is up to date You are probably right about the MM thing and can go in and switch it on but even then idk Feel like it not going to help Since you are sending from Ethereum network to Solana network you need to use a bridge Otherwise it is not possible to just transfer USDT from one network to another so not sure exactly what you are doing and what frontend you are using to do this crosschain transfer Or is Phantom capable of managing accounts on the Ethereum network I thought it was a Solanaonly frontend Phantom has ETH which is what I doing  Why nvda hasn moved Say what you want It can only go up so high Everyone on here thinks it will just keep rocketing up but the algos and whales won help when it where it is My previous post wasn drawn correctly but this one looks right Believe it if you want or not A lot of trading by the big boys isn someone saying I is the next big thing so let me run the stock up It objective data and positioning run by a robot buying and selling It can still creep up and hug the upper trend channel up until earnings but I don see it sustaining past the already unhealthy trend angle it moving in Not buying until there a correction at least to the midline Only then it will keep moving up Still won go all in when it hits midline because it may keep going down past to the bottom of the trend channel But when it does my money will be ready to go all in Its because its Friday and when Monday rolls around there will only be two days before their evening report There is already a lot of expectation of the earnings report on Wednesday built into the price So the masses are nervous and keeping their powder dry Thats why the ss not moving And without fail there the daily post from a January buyer You posted the same thing 2 weeks ago when it was at 650 Wee been holding this stock for years and have seen it go up and down multiple times without making these pointless posts It pathetic Go buy index funds Amen to this I not a day trader Got in NVDA before 2016 I think they are going to announce a split during the earnings call It only makes sense as it will help investors afford the stock and the company will increase the price over time again Win win Have fun at earnings this will age like milk  Also I don know how many earnings youe been a part of but companies have exceeded earnings and still downtrended in stocks High earnings doesn automatically equal increase in stock price Keep your powder dry and ready So were you a buyer at  the obvious from your chart  500 Nvidias price target upped to 1200 with a BUY rating from Loop Capital When for the past month plus the narrative has been ow much longer can NVDA keep up this paceIt will cool some and many market movers are ready to take some profits I expect earnings will be great and NVDA will have a sell off Which is a good thing Stocks heat and cool Look at NVDA in 2023 when it went up 200 for the year It will rebound and start a new upward climb as before With more news about AI and its latest breakthroughs keeps coming out general interest will go up for all the AI stocks,2

2024-02-20,"CNBC has a NVDA earnings countdown running It?셲 Joever Join WSB Discord Heat death of the universe? You guessed it, priced in. shits crashing harder then then when plane then then when plane Agree plane when then then? They know. They know what you bet on. They know what you will bet on. There is no escape. this is so juicy it?셲 gotta flatline. way to many premium buyers to let this move in any direction Calls....calls in the deep The loss porn will be glorious. I?셫 more excited about that than the actual earnings. The rebound for AI next week will be epic Is NVDA going to rocket tomorrow LT investor here. Earnings are never predictable. Will we exceed? yes, we usually do. Are the expectations enormous? Yes. Is the whole market looking to Nvidia for leadership? Yes So what happens if we sell off? I mean sh price is up 50% in 7 weeks. I'm expecting some profit taking, I don't feel good about how the rest of the market may take that. Long term Nvidia is going to grow. But folks should be prepared for the stock to go either way in the near term. Be defensive. - just my .02, sincerely debbie downr That?셲 why it?셲 dangerous to be in anything but Nvidia. I?셫 all in at this point and adding on dips such as today. IMO yes. At least hitting $810 Earnings is after hours on Wednesday. There maybe some last-minute moves tomorrow, but any large move would be Thursday or later. Agreed. NVDA will annihilate earnings. It dropped last quarter even after beating estimates. This quarter's earning are all ready baked into the price. No jump on Thursday. It is currently dropping and will continue through Thursday. Friday it will start to recover. Or it could rip. There?셲 no way to tell. 100% I believe in Leather Jacket man Last ER they knocked it out of the ball park by any metric yet they went down for awhile before rebounding. You think people sell low now to buy again high tomorrow? NVDA options trade Covered Call w/ protective put I?셫 getting tricked but I can?셳 figure it out. Where am I wrong? Buy 100 shares @ $682.40 Sell $400 strike call for $294.50 2/23 expiry Buy $400 strike put for $0.02 2/23 expiry Arbitrage or am I stupid? Going with stupid but please help. You?셱e missing the fact that the closing price of NVDA (ie what those options prices you?셱e using is based on) was not $682.40, it was $694.52. You?셱e using the after hours price for the stock and the end of market prices for the options. Those are not taken at the same time.  It?셲 pretty safe to assume that when you see a conversion (same strike risk reversal) trading for a price that will earn you more than the risk free rate, something you?Â��e looking at is likely incorrect . No need to take my word for it though, just try doing the trade at market open tomorrow . Yes, that?셲 what I was looking for, thank you. You capping your gain to 694.50 - 682.40 - .02 = 12.08 or $1208? Why spend $2? You think NVDA going to drop $280/42%? https://optionstrat.com/build/custom/NVDA/NVDAx100@682.4,.NVDA240223P400@0.02,-.NVDA240223C400@294.5 I have no risk of loss though with that trade? Only issue I see is the possibility to miss out huge if it spike up, say to $900, after earning. Your short call goes above the bought shares..... The premium is more than the difference, so it would get called at a slight profit. And bearish you should be. No way the stock goes up after earnings. Good prediction Why even buy the put? The covered call is already bearish Sold NVDA 1000/1030 call spreads for Feb23 I sold many NVDA 1000/1030 call spreads around $0.25 each. NVDA is around $680, so reaching $1000 is around a 50% price jump. I think the chance of 50% earning jump for NVDA is very little, especially for its $1700B market cap. I'm surprised that I'm able to sell $1000 calls for ~$0.9 each -- some people are betting on NVDA jump like crazy... This is my position, which was posted in another msg: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1aw8nmr/comment/krgfuzy/ I'm surprised you risked 3000 dollars to make 25 bucks. Dont worry, i am sure op sold 100 to make money Literally picking up pennies in front of a steamroller... This make even WSB look tame by comparison. Picking up pennies in front of nuclear bomb Yesterday I bought nvda call 1000 at 0.72 and sold some of them at 0.91. I buy far otm calls just to trade them. This doesn?셳 mean I believe the stock will reach 1000. $3000 risk to make $25 before commissions?? When you put it like that it does sound crazy. But I recently started doing put credit spreads and targeting deltas and spread combinations that gives me 1 to 15-18 reward to risk ratio. Obviously I would like something lower but that requires me to sell closer to the money spreads. My question to you is what is your acceptable reward to risk ratio? Had to double-check that I wasn?셳 reading r/wallstreetbets  The $1000 calls have a 0.01 Delta . Less than 1% chance of expiring in the money.. the gamma is also very low . Anything can happen though on fluke earnings .  You have the margin for it, right? I mean enough margin to play it until Friday? Cause, let?�� say increasing of their sales estimate and announcing a split and increased dividends can easily get you 20-25% after hours . Theta kills those short options before that happens . The price action today confirms to me this (NVDA) NVDA earnings will and stock will go parabolic We have seen crypto, AI and chips thrive the last few months. SMCI last week was an early indication of this pullback as big money pulls some out before loading it back in tomorrow. Prediction is NVDA goes north of $750 by EOW. Yes > 10% gains in next few days. They had to drop it to show the increase wasn?셳 so bad. Good luck and buckle up today is choppy and ?뙂 ?맶 can only ever rejoice for moments in the market. It?셲 all fugazi Join WSB Discord NVDA earnings call will be one of the ultimate battles between the bulls and bears. Generational bag holders will be made. If NVDA drops -$100+ tomorrow, people who bought shares in the $700s will have to become ?쐋ongterm investors?? So much pressure it may just flatline NVDA earnings will be so epic, Michael Bay will be doing a feature film on it later this year. ThEy HaD tO DrOp iT. Do a banbet so we don?셳 have to read dumb stuff like that Whenever someone's investment thesis involves something like ""they had to blah blah blah so it could blah blah"" you know that they're wrong.

2024-02-21,I told my grandson I have 4000 NVDA shares so hell wipe my ass TLDR my gullible grandson wipes my ass to get into my will because I told him I bought 4000 NVDA shares 1000 shares pre 41 split in 20182019 and am now sitting on 25 million in NVDA Im 87 and immobile in a wheelchair and dont know anything about semiconductors or anything else technology related I cannot Google or text

human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E Cheese bucks and everyone is a genius in a bull market Well almost everyone I didnt invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers Anyway I like talking stocks with my grandson because it something we could connect on and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots So in 2018 we were talking about the market and I casually brought up Nvidia He thought I didnt guide him to that at all He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with 2k he had saved up Nothing insane although he kept 90 to this day I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly retirement accounts So I told my grandson I was an OGangster called my broker and bought 1000 shares on the spot because in my words  don buy a stock if I can afford 1000 shares Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for He was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence Add in the 41 stock split and now he thinks Im sitting on 4000 shares I confirmed it to him when he brought it up in the last month I havent sold a dime and dont even know what the price is doing day to day because I dont own any shares Im just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will He thinks Im already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about He hopes to inherit my wealth someday but he also a scammy golddigging SOB and he knows it Told me aha youre a genius investor and luck has

good NVDA  Nvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and sales and said that revenue during the current quarter would be better than expected Nvidia shares rose less than 1 in extended trading Here what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG formerly known as Refinitiv Earnings 515 adjusted per share That may not compare with the 464 adjusted per share expected Revenue 2210 billion That may not compare with the 2062 billion expected Nvidia said it expected 240 in sales in the current quarter Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for 500 per share on 2217 billion in sales Nvidia reported 1229 billion in net income during the quarter or 493 per share up 33 versus last year

day in Texas One does not need to buy Nvidia to benefit from the AI boom  Check out AMAT instead Applied Materials reported robust fiscal Q1 results exceeding expectations and offering promising guidance for Q2 leading to an over 8 surge in shares The companys performance reflects its strong position in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector serving major industry players like Intel TSMC and Samsung and fully benefitting from the AI boom Despite a challenging market environment in 2023 Applied Materials demonstrated resilience maintaining flat yearoveryear revenue growth while peers experienced significant contractions Notably the companys revenue stability showcases its advantageous position and operational strength Looking ahead management anticipates improving market dynamics in 2024 particularly in the semiconductor equipment industry They foresee growth opportunities in leadingedge foundrylogic customers and expect a rebound in NAND and DRAM revenues driving demand for Applied Materials equipment Despite projecting a relatively weak Q2 management remains optimistic about the second half of 2024 They anticipate longterm growth fueled by industry complexity and the increasing importance of advanced services The companys broad portfolio and strong customer relationships position it well to capitalize on semiconductor industry trends including AI innovation and highvolume manufacturing We maintain a positive outlook on Applied Materials projecting bullish results through fiscal year 2027 They justify a premium valuation for the company given its quality stability and growth prospects Through its broad and excellent product portfolio the company actually seems like one of the better AI plays Simply put without its equipment the likes of TSMC are unable to manufacture Nvidias GPUs Therefore as demand for Nvidia GPUs grows so does demand for AMATs equipment and services You can find our full analysis of AMAT here

2024-02-22," InTC and DRIP all the political stock markets will be gone ???????   InTC  and DR Nvda risked the bisquetttttttttt cosmic hands! Join WSB Discord I?셪l still be going to work Monday ?쁻 gotta get to 4m and the legend begins Geezussss! Well done and fuck you! How much was your initial investment? 3 contracts and some stock totaling 730k Just bought 10 calls at $45 strike point at 3/15 That?셲 a winner INTC calls all the way. AI is the future! Why INTC?  NVDA was my first stock purchase ever . I plan on holding onto these shares for a very long time . I It?셲 not life-changing until you sell it Right now it?셲 just paper dreams  Of course its life changing i dont have to do additional savings anymore. Now i can use that money for other stuff... well lets see what they do with that dividend some years down the line I have stops in so yes I have near guaranteed returns, save a complete collapse Booyah. Buy & Hold ?뮞?뤌??  Do you think that buying dips over the next few years will still be enough to get the most out of this stock or should I buy $20k worth of NVDA right now? I know it?  If you want good things to happen to your money with no stress, buy a well diversified index fund . It's not sexy or exciting but I've made a good chunk of returns on my index funds . If you really believe NVDA has huge upside potential and are okay with a potential price crash, I would be comfortable getting 5 shares of NVDA at open and putting the rest in an index fund. Make sure you diversify your portfolio. Don?셳 put all your eggs in one basket (NVDA or for that matter remaining exclusively invested the AI sector as a whole). Companies (and sectors) can turn bad from time to time. For people that rode the NVDA pump ""all the way"", how did they know it would do this? NVDA is blowing my mind. I'm certainly more of a ""broader market"" type investor knowing that SP500 historically has returned 10% annually, but how did early investors of NVDA know to buy and hold until today? It's truly face-melting I can't believe it.... I've never seen anything like it I started getting into Nvidia due to the crypto miners and gamers fighting to get their hands on video cards then once AI became a moving force I just doubled down Same. I can't say I doubled down because of AI, but I grabbed a sizable position because of crypto and gaming. I kinda lucked into the AI boom. This isn't even the fastest NVDA has risen. Oct-Nov 2021, the stock popped 50% in 2 months, putting it almost 3x its price a year earlier. May 2017, similar story. And it just kept going higher at an annualized rate of 56% for a year and half after that. 2015-2016, the stock quintupled in a year and half. If they?셱e anyone like me, they just like NVIDIA GPUs and decided that that was good enough reason Gamer. Loved Nvidia GPUs. Hated Nvidia GPU prices. Channeled that hate into Nvidia stock. Profit. I bought them when they were having high demand issues because of crypto mining a few years ago. This AI shit is a pleasant and lucky surprise. Because Nancy was all in. Last i saw she was about 49% nvda with aapl google and microsoft positions Nobody knew. They just guessed and got lucky. For everyone that ?쐊new??about Nvida, there are 100 people that also ?쐊new??about stocks that have tanked. You only hear about the winners. Newbie here. Question about NVDA vs. NVDX NVDX: T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF. According to the T-Rex website, NVDX?셲 objective is to magnify (200%) the daily performance of NVDA Question1: Looking at daily % change right now, I am confused why NVDX is only 17%ish while NVDA is 15%ish. I thought NVDX?셲 number would be 30+% Question2: Anything else that?셲 not obvious but I should know about NVDX? NVDA is up 15% NVDL is up 29.65%. It is also 2x Thank you for sharing. I didnt know NVDL Is this sub the right place to ask this question? Leveraged is only for day trading due to decay don't hold it long term Really? I was gonna hold it for a month or until gtc  Since October (its inception), it's up over 200% . NVDX is a solid play. 2X leverage is an optimal amount. I wouldn't worry about decay or talk about holding these long term . I see NVDX up over 30% today. Nvidia driving AI semiconductors with results AMDs value is further proven

httpsfunfunnamcomeab2bdeca09camdaiebb098eb8f84ecb2b4ecb9a91ec9c84 Why should anyone buy Nvidia when they can buy TSMC/Samsung/Intel and get the same AI upside with less risk? Nvidia, because of explosive demand for AI, is trading at over 100 times earnings. It is priced on the assumption of a distant future where there is a continued and growing demand for AI products, and where they face little competition. The thing is, Nvidia's high gross margins are public knowledge. And they cannot produce enough chips. This gives fabs such as TSMC, Samsung, and possibly even Intel insane pricing power. On top of all this, if a competitor happens to provide a viable alternative to Nvidia, it could put significant pressure on Nvidia's margins and market share, but the fabs could continue to charge high prices per wafer. TSMC is trading at a P/E of 25 and Samsung 35, which is high, but not too high for a growing company.  There's a saying, ""During a gold rush, sell shovels"" Nvidia's AI chips are the shovels, but I'd argue the analogy leans more towards fabs like TSMC . A fab always has chips to produce, whether they're AI chips, or other purposes . Or you go all the way down, something everyone you mentioned relies on. Asml? Yeah ASML has a crazy moat and has consistently outperformed the nasdaq for over 15 years. It's a safe long term hold IMO. They have a labor shortage and struggle to scale up. Once that's sorted out they will melt faces. I?셫 buying sand. Can?셳 make silicon without sand. Ok so I wouldn't buy NVDA here buuuuuut... it isn't 100x earnings. Forward looking it's like 40 which isn't that crazy. Intel being less risk? Oh boy,.. lol must be an IBM employee Because you don't have to choose either or. I have double market weight of NVDA, TSM, ASML, AMD, and AVGO, and I'll keep adding more using a modified market cap weighted formula with the rest of my holdings. INTC is zeroed out in my formula because their corporate governance has been trash for years and they have been losing money because of it. We'll see if Gelsinger can turn the ship around, but they'll need to show two more quarters of a return to profitability before I'll buy back in. PE falls pretty quick when earnings are up 700%. Because they are not the same by that same logic you should buy Foxconn because they built iPhones, or micro. Because they built the memory for graphics cards and iPhones. Truth is nvidia has created product complexity they put together complex products and technology together and command 75%+ of margins. Nvidia: 76% gross margin, up from 66% y/y Intel: 46% gross margin. AMD: 40% gross margin. SMCI: 18% gross margin. Nvidia?셲 offerings, like the 35,000-part Hopper GPU, are not mere chips but AI supercomputers. CUDA is the default AI language. These guys are not the same. The growth is all in triple digits year over year this makes the PE come down none of the other mentioned companies has a growth story even close to this??with this kind of growth a high pe goes down quite a bit. Few understand what is really happening with Nvidia TSMC is a good play and I own some but anyone thinking there?셲 an alternative to Nvidia does not really understand what is going on. At least for now. Based on current earnings NVDA is at a P/E of 27. That's why its going up so much is because the numbers they put up with their growth rates mean it is undervalued On top of all this, if a competitor happens to provide a viable alternative to Nvidia, it could put significant pressure on Nvidia's margins and market share, but the fabs could continue to charge high prices per wafer. If a TSM competitor improves their fabs, then TSM has to charge lower prices. During a gold rush, sell shovels People love throwing this quote around. Yes TSM has the best fab right now, but you've seen the investments that have been made recently to change that. Their long term situation is rocky, not even including political influence. If you want to make this argument, ASML is the company you want to be talking about. ASML is only heavily profitable right now, due to the large number of fabs being constructed. Once the fabs are fully tooled out and running for a couple of years the profits will shift from ASML to TSMC and Intel. The semiconductor industry runs like a roller coaster.  Nvidia's valuation is dangerously high, but to say the foundries would have the same upside is just false . Nvidia only account for a small fraction of TSMC's capacity, TSMC are not redoing their pricing structure just to squeeze Nvidia .  Nvidia also have massive hook in the software stacks and talent pool thanks to proliferation of CUDA . The pure foundries do not have the software department/investment to compete with Nvidia . Intel have been late to the party for the last decade+. Nvidia's valuation is dangerously high Based on their current numbers, they are trading at a 27 PE. I wouldn't say that's dangerously high... NVDA is at a forward PE of 28. And if you assume they continue to beat analyst expectations the way they have 18 of the last 20 ER?셲, they?셱e probably closer to a forward PE of 22 right now. Compare their margins and growth rate to pretty much any company and you quickly see how ridiculously cheap they?셱e trading. I watched Amazon deploy AWS years ago and people said the exact same thing. ?쏷hey?셱e overvalued! PE is too high! Go with competitors! Stock will crater!??It was years of BS from a bunch of dumb retail investors who missed out on one of the greatest generational wealth stocks in history.  NVDA is literally going through the exact same boom. It?셲 like saying you should buy blackberry when Apple released the iPhone. Or Ford when Tesla released the model 3. Nvidia is the definition of emotional investing. You?ÂÂ pick losers and hoping they turn into winners . Someone shorted NVDA yesterday. TSMC has China baggage. That alongside margin issue make it less attractive. Samsung has its own baggage as a conglomerate. You are not just going to buy its chip manufacturing arm.  Competitors like AMD and INTC are more attractive than these 2 example . When someone/entity is dwelling in bleeding edge tech like AI development, it make more sense for them to go for the best shovel in the market . If you think not buying TSMC will protect your portfolio from a Taiwan conflict...hoo boy you are wrong. Go buy BB in 2008 and get the same smartphone upside with less risk - see how that works out for ya. Sometimes the obvious answer is also the right answer.",0
2024-02-23,"AMD puts 3K to 17K in 2 hrs.  AMD moved AMD to top of my WL as NVDA IV was so high.. Saw weakness on 5 mins candle which is 10 mins after open, while NVDA was ripping so thought yesterday it had its sympathy run so thought today MMs will drop to cover their asses . So took small gamble and bought 40 contracts at $0.80 each Join WSB Discord Congrats and f you Grats but $3200 for most on 0dte is not a small gamble. probably to most of us, it might be just pocket charge for some I have 2 small puts in play. Loving the consistent chart. Will play call once price hits 170 w a standard deviation of 4.00 i wish i understood options the way some of yall do. i dont get how this money is made so quickly It's like winning the lottery. Most people play and play and play. And never hit a win like this. And if it had for any reason gone up that day. His 3200 would have went to 200 just as quick If you think number go down, buy put, number go down, ape sell, ape happy. It???a pure gamble on what would happen here but OP bought AMD $180 puts when AMD was around $182 that expired at the end of the same day. So if AMD dropped below $180 then the puts will pay out based on what he paid for them. When AMD dropped to about $174 the puts were well in the money and OP sold for a hefty profit. They changed in value so much because they AMD dropped a good amount and they were purchased and expired on the same day so risking $3200 on something that could go to $0 within 6 hours makes them cheap to buy. Who decides after just based on sample 10 mins of 5 mins Candle at the open, example SMCI yesterday open 5 mins of candle was bullish. You don???decide to buy based on the that. It is pure Gamble. It is similar as saying I won a jackpot on lotto. Here is my analysis, when I started from home I saw a guy running very fast . His t shirt had number 7. So there was my first number. Then I saw a car drive by, its number was E29. So my lotto number was 7329 and blah blah blah.  If u knows a stock is losing volume, trend developing in a sector or is overbought u can capitalize on a predictable move . The only risk as he stated earlier are the MMs ... they know the plays before the bell opens . Since he dropped so much on a price target for a potentially confirmed signal he could of triggered a sell off Nice I grabbed calls Which trading platform is this. Webull, it???a newer one positioned like Robinhood in terms or layout/design. Used it when I was day trading for a while because it had the earliest pre market hours of any app I could find. Looks like an Email platform ig lol,this is a joke. Most people don???try this, that a stupid hunch anything could have happened, the author inly posted the one he made gain You post and show us how it's done then Congrats. I had 1300% gain on NVDA puts. I was only regarded enough for 1 contract though. Because of capital gains tax My wife was thrilled Intel CEO Discloses TSMC Production Details: N3 for Arrow Lake & N3B for Lunar Lake Intel has comically bad luck with process tech. The one time they lean into outsourcing they chose N3B, a node that costs significantly more than the mature N4P while offering 0-4% more performance and 3-8% less power for probably 40% more money. XD. There's a reason why Apple was the only N3B customer last year. Qualcomm and Mediatek opted to stay with N4P instead, and wait for N3E coming this year. N3B isn't entirely a dud though. For that 40% or whatever cost, you are also getting significantly higher transitory density. Is there any article that actually shows what was asked and what the answer was? This article is hilarious trash. They literally quote the correct details and then throw in a bullshit rumor that contradicts it. According to a China Times news article: ""Gelsinger also confirmed the expansion of orders to TSMC, confirming that TSMC will hold orders for Intel's Arrow and Lunar Lake CPU, GPU, and NPU chips this year, and will produce them using the N3B process, officially ushering in the Intel notebook platform that the outside world has been waiting for many years."" Well, N3B isn't used for the GPU or SoC tile. But giving the benefit of the doubt, that's immediately followed by... Past leaks have indicated that Intel's Arrow Lake processor family will have CPU tiles based on their in-house 20A process, while TSMC takes care of the GPU tile aspect with their 3 nm N3 process node No, N3B is used for both LNL and the ARL CPU tile, not ARL GPU or anything else. 20A is supposed to also be used for the CPU tile, but N3B is the guaranteed one. 20A will be used for some mobile ARL CPU tiles, right? Wasn?셳 arrow lake suppose to be on 20A? And what for their GPUs? Which ones? Battlemage is N5/N4 family. Xe2 in LNL is on the N3B compute die. And ARL uses basically a refresh of the MTL die. Talk about being a foundry and immediately disclose how your product team prefers another foundry.  Intel doesn't have much EUV capacity as far as I can tell and they are still relying on DUV . Intel 7 is their last DUV node and that's being used for their 14th gen desktop chips and Emerald Rapids . Meteor lake uses Intel 4 but right behind it are Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids which will use Intel 3 . They don't have much of a choice but to go to TSMC if they want a competitive high volume node. ""Gelsinger also confirmed the expansion of orders to TSMC, confirming that TSMC will hold orders for Intel's Arrow and Lunar Lake CPU, GPU, and NPU chips this year, and will produce them using the N3B process, officially ushering in the Intel notebook platform that the outside world has been waiting for many years."" So Intel is only making the IO die for Arrow Lake? For N3B ARL, the only thing Intel makes is the passive base die. So nothing of value. Is Lisa Su a rookie Its divine Looks like its going up Hmm Wow Its dizzying How far are you going to go",6

Add your thoughts and get the conversation going.  There is discussion about the ethereum dencun update, which makes txn costs lower, which directly pressures one Solana?셲 main benefits of negligible costs, high speed, and high throughput are being addressed by ethereum improvements. to be very clear, i am not an eth shill or maxi. i am curious how solana will differentiate going forward. Dencun WILL make gas cheaper for the ETH mainnet and the layer 2s. That is cool ?삇. It's still going to be expensive AF and slow though. I was doing some OP stuff yesterday and it cost 40 cents to send some OP and it was slow. ETH has miles to go before the user experience can be similar to Solana. well said. reducing fees is a good start, but EVM has a lonnggg way to go to catch SOL speed and transaction cost Because this is a Solana sub, answers will be biased to Solana. I don't know I'm just tired of this ETH v SOL topics. I think that both can coexist in cryptospace. And yes I hold like 3x the amount of ETH in SOL, but they both performed perfectly for me so I can't be even mad. It?셲 for layer2?셲 and Solana is a layer 1. Monolithic blockchains are a different discussion but there are pros and cons to both sides I think. Here's how adoption works- User uses app. User decides how that experience felt. User decides if they want to re experience. User builds habit. Coming soon is not an experience. Love both ethereum and Solana. Solana is way more fun to use. b/c ETH gas fees are so high, it will never be 'fixed' but btc n eth are still the top 2 so the biggest wallets still trust btc n eth no matter how bullish alts are, most the profits still get taken into more btc n more eth, thats just the game, no diff than spl tokens getting dumped for more sol. 0.01 eth 10 yrs ago was peanuts, smilarly 0.01 sol today is peanuts. if sol gets to 3000, the 0.01 sol become $30 usd, so not exactly peanuts. BTC n ETH, they are trusted n tried. Time. Because you should learn that this has nothing to do with Solana, dencun is for L2 not L1 etherum is far from solving their expensive L1 and at this stage they reckon it could be year before they do 3 years holding This is no joke Bot Frontruns my swap Txn to make 4% instant profit  I have a general question regarding txns.

The bot makes a instant 4.1% profit ?삷 Pretty normal with loq liquidity shitcoins. Try upping your fee on jupiter Google MEV arbitrage trading. Basically, your transaction sits in a small pool before getting pushed to the chain. Miners will collect your transaction and sandwich theirs on the front and back, and process all three in order. This happens in milliseconds. You can avoid this (I think) by upping your fee, which basically shortens the time allotted and cuts into their arbitrage opportunity. It?셲 also very dependent on which validators you get pushed through. I know Jito has a ton of validators and their own MEV bot which uses these pools. I don?셳 know much more beyond that. At the end of the day though, you can?셳 beat them. Either you pay a higher fee to avoid them, or you pay a slightly higher price when they front run you. There?셲 word that some trading bots like ThunderBot are MEV resistant, but I haven?셳 used it enough to confirm or deny. I know I get sandwhiched on BonkBot, but I?셶e just accepted that fact. All of these responses are wrong. You cannot avoid it by upping fees or decreasing slippage. Birdeye uses Jupiter swap api and Jupiter price quotes are delayed currently.

Over 100 dollars Hanmi Semiconductor and Micron Lets go It would be nice You said you were going to commission production to tsmc because you couldnt stack memory but you used hybrid bonding The unit price of production must be very expensiveNow the world where memory also uses foundry Microns daily downfall ends Im Samjeon Said to outsource production to TSMC Micron is massproduced before Samsung What are the real risks of investment in TSMC ??! TSMC Political situation with China Xi Jinping TSMC is one of the bargaining chips Taiwan uses to deter an invasion. They know the world won't sit idly by if their access to the best and most advanced chips is threatened. Earthquake being the first - they sit right in seismic fault - and China the second. But they are opening a factory in Japan , would this minimize the risk ? Aren?셳 they opening one in the US too? Look at etf SMH. One of the top holdings is TSM but you get exposure to other chip stocks too Long term, TSMC has been very strong for me. If you want exposure, but not too much, $SMH is a great ETF to get into TSMC. Invasion is not one of them... If anything China hitting back with competitive chips is by far the greatest risk...  They are building a foundry in the US, which is good. I was expecting more competition from INTC, but they?셶e already delayed the start of their Ohio foundry. Risk is AI rollout is slower than expected. And a chip surplus would mean less demand for TSM. I?셫 long. I would invest into TSM, but at the same time to Samsung and INTC. To be ready if China shoots a bullet on Taiwan?? Political risks The real enemy is INTEL Can you explain more , please Is it a 60 or 100 year company like Coca-Cola? Is it a monopoly like Microsoft? Is TSMC a monopoly or can it become one? Are there physical limits and expenses to chip manufacturing?  Is Ai a threat or help for chip manufacturing? Is cloud a threat to consumer chips?  These are the questions you want to be asking.",8

the previous record  Setting a new alltime high this year but selling is meh How the hell is AMD stock not skyrocketing right now Last time I checked the whole reason why Nvideas stock has been going up this whole time was because for workplace environments like rendering certain programs used Nvideas Cuda technology and didnt work as well on AMD cards If that is the case why havent people started investing more into AMD stock when it just came out thar AMD has been secretly making ZLUDA a past open source cuda alternative for Intel cards try to work on amd cards Its apparently been in development for the past 2 years and AMD is actively ZLUDA 3 Its out right now and it will only get better Besides the fact Nvidea has a mainstream control of AI once AMD gets their open source cuda implementation up and running smoothly as equal or even better than Nvideas closed source cuda implentation in the next couple years wont this just make nvidea stock price drop AMD will have more competitiveness if they are able to compete with Nvideas actual Cuda technology and therefore will just sell more gpus Maybe Im just a lunatic but isnt investing into AMD more logical than Nvidea at the moment Am I cooking up something and not just being an idiot but instead a master mind genius Only time will tell Im going in on AMD for the foreseeable future Join WSB Discord AMD is up almost 30 year to date Yeah Not as impressive as NVDA but impressive anyway they still need to deliver on the earnings the same way NVDA has done for them to rocket at the same level But come on30 in 2 months Yeah lmao OP is REEEEEing about AMD lagging behind when its at basically an ATH and has gone up 80 in 4 months  They have historically filled a similar role in GPU You probably right that the riskreward ratio favors AMD over Nvidia but I think you overestimate the probability of AMD successfully replicating the commercial success of Nvidia It might happen and if it does youget paid but it also might not happen AMD has some great products that seem to get better every couple years AMD in a five or ten year time frame is certainly a multi bagger but nobody here buys stocks and they damn sure doninvest beyond ten hour time frames lol My AMD is up 163 in a little over year Seems good to me Omg why only 163 and not 700 Why is staying still once AMD gets their open source cuda implementation up and running smoothly as equal or even better than Nvideas closed source cuda implentation in the next couple years I dunno how someone can read this and not realize the OP is genuinely regarded AMD stock is getting ahead of its revenues in one year the stock has gained 125 but revenues donreflect the same growth as the share price in fact for 2023 they earned less than they did in 2022 While NVDA stock is up 200 in one year but their revenues have also grown by 125 It skyrocketed a 40 yieldConsidering the opportunity costLets go to 120 this year NVDAs news release httpwwwbizwnewscomnewsarticleViewhtmlidxno77594enliple Should I sell now Maximum beneficiary stockStarting mass productionEverything I make is NvidiaShould I buy it Stock Correlation between TSMC and NVDA It looks like most of NVDAs chips are made by TSMC Why isnt tsmc stock rallying like NVDA and its PE ratio is only 25 compared NVDAAMDs very high PE values If Nvidias or AMDs forward pe is so good then TSMCs forward pe also should be good right Whats your take on this TSMCs lower PE compared to NVDA and AMD boils down to growth expectations and risk profiles Nvidia and AMD are riding the wave some call it a bubble of AI They have skyhigh PEs due to their bright earnings outlook TSMC despite being the backbone of the industry gets a steadier valuation Its all about perception TSMC is seen as a solid and indispensable player but without the same growth narrative Its heavy investment in its foundry plus its geopolitical situation given its based in Taiwan add layers of complexity TSMC valuation is based more on its current role as a reliable industry cornerstone rather than a highgrowth play Revenue stream of TSM is not 100 hcp or data center the percentage of revenue in those area is much smaller comparing NVDA NVDA margin is much higher when you compare TSM to NVDA or even AMAT and ASML you might notice that TSM capex is much higher it the difference in business models Foundry is still a capital intensive and asset heavy business which normally has a lower valuation Not to mention other like competitions landscape geopolitics etc Couldnt TSMC raise their prices to take a larger piece of NVDAs margin Nvidia are in a class of their own in GPUs TSMC is the best in the world at making the most advanced semiconductor nodes but the market seems to expect competition from the likes of Intel and AMD even though their position on top has been maintained so far and for the last 20 years or so Also TSMC does not capture as much of the value stream from AI as Nvidia does though its also not entirely dependent on it becuase most of its revenue is not AI related and will always have demand for the latest nodes from customers like Apple for smartphones If a famous artist bought their supplies from hobby lobby does that make Hobby Lobby any more special China will probably invade Taiwan in 20242025 TSMC have huge geopolitical risk don invest in it if you aren greed but ride this current AI trend for a year or two is fine but ChineseTaiwanese relationship is risky under this proindependent President I am not an expert on either but I am an Electrical Engineer EE by trade Designers generally make more than people who manufacture and put out bids for manufacturing but considering TSM has basically a monopoly I not sure this principle applies There is a distinction between someone like ASML who designs and sells the machines that TSM uses and NVDA to TSM who designs the boards that will be made That being said TSM iirc owns around 90 of advanced semiconductor manufacturing httpswwwcnbccomamp20220817chinaneedstaiwansbiggestchipmakermorethantheotherwayaroundhtml so you think tsm would be able to capitalize on that advantage Tsm also pays a dividend so it sorta in a different category of stocks that more recently a company like META would fall into that typically has less growth than companies who do not pay dividends That being said the avg spy500 PE ratio is around 21 in the last year and semiconductors as of recent have been high growth Tsm has had supply issues as of recent as well as geopolitical issues but with news about new plants in Japan and the US TSM does seemed to be positioned in an interesting spot From an EE perspective we are reaching physical limits on how small switches can be which is where the whole nm conversation comes in which now have to take theory from quantum mechanics into account for designing parts I have not worked in design but had 2 professors that worked at Intel and took design classes and the barrier to entry seems incredibly high to me I know there has been news about Microsoft lately trying to break into the market but there is so much involved from software like Cadence used to design the chips to seemingly infinite things that can go wrong from a manufacturing processes and with a higher cost of labor in the US compared to Taiwan I not sure it realistic to have all the manufacturing done domestically From a security perspective it makes sense but from a cost perspective I highly doubt it does TSMC doesn command a pricing premium like Nvidia Most of the value in that value chain is paid to Nvidia Check out the revenue charts of TSM vs Nvidia Cant TSMC hike their prices to take more of that premium We cant forget about the ChinaTaiwan situation That is also a burden on TSMCs growth When is the last time you bought a phone laptop and desktop AI is still a small part of overall world chip sales TSMC shouldnt be trading at a PE of 18 and it isnt anymore But its forward PE could be higher than NVDAs now Not to mention AI server spend usually lowers CPU spend somewhat i viewed TSMC as quite volatile anyone else or just me,6
2024-02-28,"HDMI Forum Rejects OpenSource HDMI 21 Driver Support Sought By AMD HDMI forum approves DisplayPort being the best option for users Someone in the community cant be AMD needs to just say fuck it and do it anyways Thats the true Linux way sometimes Eg DVDBluray playback in VLC Easier said than done of course I want to build a living room gaming PC running SteamOS or ChimeraOS something like that But I think Ill have to go with Nvidia HDMI 21 is a must Unless there are adapters that will work at 4K 120 Hz with HDR and VRR I mean AMD could quietly fund someone to do an open source implementation just like they and Intel funded the ZLUDA guy Well I hate it I have an LG C2 with only hdmi ports and a GPU that is capable of driving the 4K display at 120fps but its not able to in linux Not unless I mess with the edid settings or patch amdgpu timings and risking to brick my device  Why does the hdmi group just suck Why does the hdmi group just suck They want constant money Not surprising at all The HDMI Forum exists to a large extent to make sure that DRM can extend all the way to the physical pixels on a screen thus making it impossible to bypass digital restrictions by hooking into the raw video data sent over the display cable Obviously HDMI support in an open source video driver would ruin that because in order to make DRM over HDMI possible the drivers on both ends need access to some kind of cryptographic key and an open source driver would have to release that key under an open source license which in turn would enable anyone to legally embed that key in their own code thus rendering the DRM ineffective Keep in mind that the purpose of DRM is not to keep malicious people from committing copyright infringement it is to restrict the ways in which lawabiding consumers can watch the content they paid for so its not necessary to make it technically impossible to bypass the DRM you just need to make it illegal to do so and keeping the cryptographic keys behind restrictive licenses achieves that  but once the key is part of an opensource codebase using the key for whatever you want including bypassing the DRM is now explicitly allowed by the license They dont even have to release the key though look at Chromecast for example  the code is free but you cant cast to anything that doesnt have the key locked down Fuck HDMI All my homies use DisplayPort I hope the HDMI standard dies entirely in favour of DisplayPort instead The HDMI Forum are such dickheads that if I became president overnight Id break them up even though I hate government overreach in general Is there a specific advantage that hdmi 21 has over displayport 14 Thanks for my regular reminder not to buy a TV Shame theyre decent large panels for a decent price compared to the overpriced smaller panel monitor market I know theyre subsidised by all the smart adridden shit they all have these days but the solution is dont connect them use them as a dumb display Some TVs can be great monitors I use one daily on Linux with a new AMD GPU Unfortunately the HDMI Forum is comprised of greedy fucks and I cant get the functionality I technically paid for Another reason why DisplayPort is superior Sounds like a matter for the FTC I fucking hate the HDMI forum Repeat after me HDMI is the inferior product I will now base my purchasing decisions on DisplayPort AMD should make an open source display connection protocol that has optional backward compatibility with HDMI Like DP Does this ruling prevent bittorrent from downloading the video they are trying to protect Hynix cant keep up I want you to stand out in the middle of a crash Intel is catching up to TSMC and we might be missing its revival as our attention is focused on NVIDIA Intel announced earlier in the week that they are rolling out 18 nm and 2 nm chips possibly 14 nm even As far as I know the best TSMC does is 3 nm Theyve already bagged Microsoft as a customer and apparently has 4 more customers lined up I feel that the market wants to get some more validation around it So as and when these customers are announced there can be movements in its stock price Though I am not sure as the current PE ratio of Intel at 104 already seems quite high Ive written a small article about how Intels IP protectionism led them falling so far in my blog The fab process nomenclature gets murkier and murkier Intels 10nm was reportedly better than TSMCs 7 nm but it remains to be seen how good this latest node will be and if therell be delays The Microsoft deal was announced about a week ago Edit httpswwwpcgamercomintelceoadmitsivebetthewholecompanyon18a Video of Gelsinger discussing 18A for anyone interested Intels lifetime deal value for its IFS foundry business is now over 10 billion indicating strong growth potential in advanced packaging TSMC will supply Intel with 5000 Foveros wafers per month generating potential packaging revenues of 61429 million per year Intels Foveros packaging technology is expected to generate 5 of the companys overall revenues of 68 billion in 2026 NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE Feb 15 2021  Patrick Pat Gelsinger became CEO of Intel
AMD was a manyyear journey to get where its at today but AMD also struggled hard for many years before it got its act together It was a rough few years for Intel were still not at the five year hallmark metric for FULL company turn around But Intel is in a truly better position than if the previous CEO was in position to run it to the ground Consumer sector
Today as of 2024 Intel does have very competitively priced discrete GPUs and CPUs are performing exceptionally well compared to previous generations
From 20182021 Intel had a very tough time  disappointing roadmap and tech performance roundup per yeartodate analysis Commercial and B2B deals  Many great things coming for Intel Wont speak for their disappointing stock performance in the past ten years  but Intel is likely headed for the sunshine
But invest for the long game just dont put all your eggs in one basket Got it I understand master going yolo all in on Intel calls Im not fully convinced that Intel could surpass TSMC Since recently US government began to indicate that it wants to produce as much chips as possible locally in US as it is a matter of national security And that where intel has a lot of advantages over other tech companies I also think that this is not fairly priced in yet as intl is in constant decline since the beginning of the year While US government continues to announce subsidies which directly target intel Maybe investors want some real actions from the government and not just promises As for 18 nm and 2 nm chips intel recently announced that it had to delay their new fabs for a year or so It also hard to see intel as tsmc competitor because unlike tsmc intel also designs the chips And is a competitor of the nvidia for example So nvidia will probably hesitate to give its designs to intel to manufacture as it basically would mean giving away its secrets to the competitor In that sense for intel to succeed they not only need to have good fabs but also be able to design good chips Which could be very problematic considering there financial situation Companies like nvidia or Apple have all money in the world to hire the best engineers while intel probably have to also compromise here Yeah I agree What folks have forgotten is that intel actually has a higher PE than NVIDIA 106 to 65 And yet people are so worried that NVIDIA is over valued With how these chips and shit work 123 nm means nothing and hasn for a while it jargon and not indicative of the actual size Architecture is more important than the size of the node Intel has a long history of under delivering its promises Yeah I still think back to Pat proudly saying AMD was in the rear view mirror Over promising and under delivering for too many years now Intel never fails to disappoint Is Intel a new start up or something never heard of them Ie been quietly accumulating the dip the last few days and am coming into their next bull run with a great average I think  Quietly You havent notified the media Meanwhile me with 33 average and not planning to sell until at least 200 I never liked the words Projection Missing Rival or Catching Up The semiconductor is cyclical and the demand is at peak now so if you are not getting a significant market share at this moment then you are just not getting enough competitive advantages I always and only base on facts that the companies need to have reliance from the clients Who will be eliminated when budget of these main clients like Meta Microsoft Google is tighten Who will be the first choice for the high end chips TSMC has gross margin over 50 means strong pricing power they have the advantage to cut the price down to gain more market share if demand goes down TSMC is the main manufacturer of Nvidia who has even stronger pricing power I don believe anything until I see it It show me time talking is not going to work Sultan Selangor amat dukacita dengan kenyataan Hadi Awang bukti presiden pas masih lagi mengekalkan manat Haji Hadi  1981ak

open source HDMI 21 implementation Someone should convince TV makers to include a displayPort port so we can sidestep this madness DisplayPort can carry HDMI signals adapters can be very simple because of that We should start by including DisplayPort in laptops and so on Then theyll see that there is actually a use for that What can 270k penguins do Can we just stop using HDMI DisplayPort has a superior connector and doesnt require a fee way ahead of you But we have so many devices with HDMI Itnot that easy Also who are these idiots from HDMI Forum I need names DisplayPort TVs when When DisplayPort enforces HDCP Highbandwidth Digital Content Protection My understanding is that DRM is the primary reason that TVs still use HDMI Imagine using a proprietary spec as an industry standard The industry screwed themselves with this one AMD and we the users should just report these assholes to the EU Even if we dont succeed I really like to seem them getting fines like Apple I wish they get something between 100500 millions httpsgitlabfreedesktoporgdrmamdissues1417note2303163 Friends dont let friends use HDMI Too bad there are no monitors with DisplayPort but without HDMI Theres a simple fix AMD to stop releasing products with HDMI outputs Thatd just lower their marketshare and competitiveness even more The HDMI forum as if the number of people responsible for this decision wouldnt fit around a dinner table Display Port is the better standard anyways Dont buy HDMIonly hardware Reminder that the HDMI forum is adjacent to the copyright DRM mafia They love control wouldnt it be funny if suddenly a HDMI 21 implementation that can be patched into the AMD driver appeared on the internet and people would copy it 100000 times spreading it all over the internet

NVIDIA and AMD are both fabless chipmakers, meaning they do not manufacture most of their chips in-house. Instead they outsource production to the contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (Ticker: TSM). Oh, and by the way, every Apple iphone has a chip produced by Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel will spend $14 billion on manufacturing its new chips at TSMC: Report | Tom's Hardware (tomshardware.com) As of 2021, the top customers of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) include: Apple: Apple is the largest customer of TSMC, contributing a quarter of the company?셲 revenues.

The kind of research that gets posted here From 2018* TSMC has being light years ahead of everyone for at least a decade lol. TSMC is so critical that the Taiwanese government rigged it to explode if china invaded lol. You're telling us to buy TSM? thanks, what a totally new idea that hasn't been on this sub for years Should we also buy MU? I reccomend getting high and reading about how microchips are made. Wild Inside a wafer fab is a terrible place to be high, ask me how I know  Intel is playing catch up after years of bad strategy has caused them to fall behind . NVDA so far has been the stronger play for me, but I just get the feeling it?셲 too soon . There is one company that supplies all semiconductor manufacturing plants: ASML. I have >50% in ASML, literally made me a millionaire. Ok but ASML is overbought too for anyone who didn?셳 previously buy like you How can I go back 3 years and buy this too? How did you discover ASML before it popped off? I'm banking on Intel to rise once they sell ai chips in 2024. It's gonna be a year long hold for me. I saw a week or two ago about how intel was gonna make their own chips and challenge TSMC. and now they are just going to pay TSMC? They've been paying tsmc, they're making plants too build more advanced chips in the future But but bu... P-pat told me Intel's 0.7nm node was ready and INTC would produce their superchips at Intel megafactories. And we would party like it's 1985. I guess that's another 6 years of Intel lagging behind AMD. Asml. Tsm. No intl . It?셲 a good tactic for Intel - stuff TSMC foundries with Intel wafers so other companies have to use intels foundries Edit: didn?셳 think I?셝 need this but I was wrong /s If intel wants to get in the foundry business, TSMC is their biggest competitor and this is funding them directly - not something you do just for the lolz. R.e. Edit: i have seen multiple people saying that entirely unironically, so i didn?셳 want to assume anything. in fact, look no further than a couple comments below -_- Intrigued to see what 15th gen will be like. bummer, but not a bummer.. I am conflicted here. Not a bummer for Intel at all if the analyst's predictions come true. 25-30K N3 wafers a month for Lunar Lake and other client chips? That's an insane amount of revenue. Not sure if this is what Pat originally meant by ?? nodes in 4 years??$TSMC So Intel right now is just another AMD? Outsourcing their cutting edge chips to TSMC is basically admitting that their own leading process is not good enough. What happened to their ambitious plan to come back as the leader of foundry business? It totally depends on what chips are outsourced. Intel has been a TSMC customer for many years. Intel 4 and Intel 20A are not library complete nodes - they're optimized specifically for x86 compute tiles. Intel 3 and 18A are the refined, library complete versions of these nodes.  Lunar Lake combines NPU, iGPU, and Compute on a single tile . Intel 4 and 20A are not viable nodes for Lunar Lake . Lunar Lake could be delayed 6 - 9 months and wait for 18A .  Intel nodes and design teams aren't working tightly together anymore like in the past, where Intel nodes were highly optimized to work with their own designs, and their designs were not portable to other foundries . Intel Fab designs standardized nodes now that compete for customers . Intel design has more flexibility in which fabs they choose for their now-portable designs What happened to the investments with chips act? These contracts and roadmaps for chips are done years in advance. The plants the chips act funds takes years to build.

Just curious how everyone else typically plays NVDA call options! Don?셳 mess around with short term calls. Buy OTM with a longer expiration and hold while you watch it grow. And if you?셱e that nervous you shouldn?셳 be messing around with options to begin with.  The threat of ?��V crush??is what scared me into selling before the late day dip today .

I think Im going to lose it once TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America First off, let's talk about TSM, the heart and soul of Taiwan. TSM to Taiwan is what MSFT/APPL are to the US. It will never die, and they're going to run this shit up. Look on Friday, they bid it up 5%. They're going to squeeze it like TSLA in 2021, and NVDA now. All this FOMO into semis recently? Well we still got a ways to go, and I'm making fucking money off of it. Overvalued, yes probably, but we are no where near the levels of CSCO in the 2000s. Now, why TSM over NVDA, SMCI, ASML or INTC? NVDA - I am balls deep in NVDA shares, but it is too overextended with a 2T marketcap. Can we see it overtake MSFT/AAPL? Maybe. If we run like how we did in 2000, we probably will. SMCI - Sure there are some fundamentals driving this run up, but lets be honest, its all of us degenerates bidding this shit up and buying calls. The rug can be pulled easily (see when we went from 1000 to 700 in a day), but monkey together strong. Don't see why the S&P 500 committee added this, but oh well. ASML - you fuckheads can't buy it on Robinhood, there is no chance of a squeeze. INTC - they talk a big game, but they never deliver. So much roadmap slippage. Could not deliver 4nm. Just Ls after Ls. Leadership churn. I know its a retirement home over there. SO WHY TSM? - No one can fucking compete with these guy's yields. Samsung needs to fabricate FIVE times as many wafers to even match TSMC's yield. Do your own DD here - https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php POSITIONS: 100 contracts 150C - 4/19 - $31,000 cost basis 50 contracts 140C - 4/19 - $28,900 cost basis See you fucks on the moon. Join WSB Discord Also, my 60 shares will guarantee the TSM rocket?쫦ou?셱e welcome. I would buy shares and hold long term. Semiconductors aren't going away and TSM is by far the biggest/best maker of chips. And by the way, while it's called ""Taiwan"", majority of the shareholders are US/EU investors so in essence it's a western company already. oh man posts like this makes me question my position lol  I got some calls for TSM's next earnings, they are very OTM for now but hopefully they should be away from IV crush . I have 5 5/17 $170c, 5 6/21 $180c, 10 6/20 $200c and 2 LEAPS 1/17/25 $180C . What is the price target you are looking at for TSM until next earnings? I agree with ops DD. I bought calls this morning for may. I suspect Tsm will do a nvda at some point and climb over 400 dollars minimum. I support Taiwan so I?셫 buying 2-3 more calls tomorrow morning at 165 or 170 call for may. $145 cs for 4/19. demand is at all time high, former CEO recently said they need ??0 fabs??to meet 1 or 2 customer?셲 demands. They guided higher for this quarter and I think they will have a huge beat. Cyclical and we are in the cycle. TSMC earnings lead the market direction in Jan. gadget / smartphone consumer growth is up from last quarter. their customers are reporting record beats / guidance. The comps aren?셳 the same as a designers but the food chain will all eat. AI catalyst for the market are only possible through this company. Auto and memory demand will be down but a small percent of their revenue. capex will decrease. Japan?셲 plant for TSMC is officially open. Second plant in Japan just got $4.8 bil in subsidies. Biden admin to announce subsidies in coming week or two for CHIP act and TSMC will receive. Arizona, Germany fabs underway. one of the best management teams, per Buffet. China is a non-factor.

This is not a face-ripper I have 145 call option expiring on 5/17 It is already up at 600% TSM definitely has the potential to breakout similar to NVDA and SMCI. I?셫 actually surprised it hasn?셳 taken off. I?셝 be willing to bet money the cheapest calls for 4/19 $200 will be close to ITM in 6 weeks or less. TSM! TSM! TSM!! TS?쫛h wait wrong TSM??$TSMC War with china is priced in. TSM is going to the moon, I am going to fuck your mom and there is nothing you can do about any of that. Earnings will be 4/18 and the 4/19 calls are attractive... You get the run up from rumors without the iv crush if you manage it before the news. Buy the company selling the shovels to the gold miners you know ? I?셫 along for this ride. I?셫 all in 5/17 calls so I automatically agree with everything you said until I sell them. I?셫 pissed. I had the TSM revelation on Sunday similar to everything you?셶e said and put in an order for $4k in $150 calls for May. I checked in at 10am this morning and they doubled in price and my order never went through. I put in an order at the new price and then the price dropped lol. I?셫 not worried bc it will still be profitable I just had the absolute worst timing with like an hour span lol. You see those big $140C 4/19 buys, too? Planting explosives in your factory in case China invades is a baller move. Calls on TSM I got some 5/17 $150 calls and was close to 100% today before the downturn.

Mellanox is better for high speed networking in shorter distances. Marvell is better for AI and Cloud applications. Marvell is an important piece in datacenter.

2024-03-05,"Average price 106 When it dropped below 80Im so thankful that I didnt sell Crazy company High dividends and tremendous growth Dutch gov't scrambling behind the scenes to keep ASML in the Netherlands: report Is this a bad thing? given the pressure from the public to reduce immigration. Brexit teach nothing  If this anti immigration sentiment continues everyone in The Netherlands will be poorer . ASML is a great company, contributing significantly to the Dutch economy . Pushing away high paid expats that not only pay way more tax than the average Dutch person, but creates soo much value that the Dutch profit from .  As a highly skilled migrant, I came to the NL on the 10 years 30% ruling . I now live and have built a family with a Dutch woman in the NL . I wouldn't have chosen the NL with the current stance on the tax break . Say it louder for the tokkies It's a horrible thing, economically, socially and just in terms of innovation. Especially since this type of immigration"" brings the best and the smartest people on the planet here."" There was a post about benefits for expats a few days ago in this sub. I've lived in NL a long time now, and no tech team here can survive without expats, not even close. Good engineers/scientists/etc no longer have a good enough reason to pick Netherlands over any other Western European country... actually top talents will most likely never choose NL over UK or Germany, and this was the case even 5 years ago. I'm not surprised at all by this article, I'm more surprised articles like this have not popped up more before. Pretty sad and worried where this country is headed towards. The reality is that most dutch people work in cozy jobs and are totally unaware at how ""uncozy"" and difficult most expats jobs are Average Western European country lol The same thing happened to Philips in the 60s 70s. Not just because east Asia was cheap labor, but man, they simply ran out of housing (and Philips had to resort to building their own company housing) which still wasn't enough. Now Philips is just a shell of its former self. Kinda crazy to think how such a gigantic key jewel of the NL is being irresponsibly tossed around in favor of cheap populist rhetorics as ??0% ruling bad??or ?쐔oo many expats?? To me it feels like the animosity towards expats are 90% related to housing even though housing is a problem created by speculation. Houses were made to be homes, not to be assets in someone?셲 portfolio. I think something people don't realize is that many companies don't really have a reason to be here except a highly skilled workforce.  My company in the finance sector pays tens of millions in corporate taxes only with a handful of employees in a 150 sqmt office, with more than 90% expats . Wouldn't even take 3 months to set up shop in another country, just need a few monitors and an internet connection . The funny thing is we had an open position for my team and exactly zero Dutch people applied. It was a demanding 40 hr job, with a really good salary. Housing problem is real, but targeting kennismigrants is idiotic. If there's a housing problem and you want to keep the economy strong, just build houses, don't try to scare away the people creating value. Ethernet on my Home Server completely busted Hello, I'm running Ubuntu 22.04/6.5 kernel and my Ethernet port stopped working entirely after a random upgrade and reboot. A few weeks ago I made this post on the Ubuntu subreddit about my issues with the Ethernet port since upgrading to Ubuntu 22.04 (basically the speed was capped at 100 Mpbs even though I had tested known good cables and ports in the switch). None of the solutions I found/was suggested ended up working so I let the issue aside since I had better things to do. The problem is that after running a random apt-get upgrade and reboot, the ethernet port isn't working at all. Here's the output of lshw -C network: *-network UNCLAIMED description: Ethernet controller product: RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. physical id: 0 bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0 version: 10 width: 64 bits clock: 33MHz capabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix vpd bus_master cap_list configuration: latency=0 resources: ioport:3000(size=256) memory:a1104000-a1104fff memory:a1100000-a1103fff *-network description: Wireless interface product: Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 Plus Bluetooth vendor: Intel Corporation physical id: 0 bus info: pci@0000:02:00.0 logical name: wlp2s0 version: 99 serial: xxx width: 64 bits clock: 33MHz capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless configuration: broadcast=yes driver=iwlwifi driverversion=6.5.0-21-generic firmware=29.4063824552.0 7265D-29.ucode ip=192.168.100.10 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11 resources: irq:127 memory:a1000000-a1001fff  I ended up plugging the old wifi card back into the board since I can't afford to look for a solution while the server is offline . The wifi card is actually a bit faster than the ethernet port (250Mbps instead of 100) but this is not an ideal solution for me, I want the reliability of wired connections . If nothing else works, would an USB Ethernet adapter do the job? I'm afraid of wasting money and ending up with the same driver issues I was having since most adapters I find use the same Realtek controller that's already onboard. Every solution to this problem I googled suggest installing linux-modules-extra, it was already installed before the issue came up and I did a reainstall for good measure, no deal It's a Realtek. Bin it and buy an Intel. Intel doesn't make USB Ethernet chips do they? If you mean buy a full sized pci-e card, my server runs off of a displaced notebook motherboard. I found some shady ass adapters that turn the wifi A+E pci slot into an Ethernet port, but they're Realtek too Intel is better, realtek works just fine. I mix both. Actually find it easier in multi nic configurations to have different manufacturer...makes config and drivers that must easier to logically deal with. No need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. This person had the same problem and has the same Ethernet chipset. There is a solution at the bottom of the page. https://askubuntu.com/questions/1398448/ethernet-internet-speed-stuck-at-100-mbps-for-gigabit-connection-ubuntu-20-04?darkschemeovr=1 Yes, I tried that solution back then and found out aspm was already off, didn't work anyway. My problem now is that the Ethernet port stopped working altogether after a reboot.  Ethtool can do that for you. May be your problem, may not, but you can try . https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ethtool-command-change-speed-duplex-ethernet-card-linux Yeah I tried forcing gigabit speed with ethtool too, but it would just drop the connection and not reconnect until I set to autonegotiate back In any case I had given up on the gigabit speed for the moment, my issue now is that the Ethernet port stopped working entirely after a reboot (maybe I should reword the OP, my bad) Try this: I assume I should adapt this solution to the r8168 driver? 8821 is for the wireless chip which is working fine. I left for work, gonna try this later, thanks Geheime operatie kabinet onder codenaam ?섳eethoven??om dreigend vertrek ASML Wat houd ASML tegen om bijvoorbeeld zelf 20 grote flats te zetten in de buurt van Veldhoven?

De kosten zijn volgens mij het probleem niet als personeel zo belangrijk voor ze is. Het bestemmingsplan. De jaren die deze aanvraag duurt. De stikstof norm die de meeste bouw stil legt. De omwonende buren die jaren protest aan zullen tekenen omdat ze nu naast veel meer mensen wonen. De monumenten belang groepen die tegen elke vorm van afbraak zijn. De natuurmensen die tegen elke vorm van natuur gebruiking zijn. Etc. Hetzelfde geldt voor de regels voor expats, waarom betaal je ze niet iets meer om te compenseren voor de afbouw?  Dit is een subsidie van honderden miljarden per jaar voor de rijkste bedrijven in Nederland . De persoon geeft er niks om, want die kreeg hetzelfde netto salaris . We moeten het ASML niet moeilijk maken, maar iedere starter heeft al moeite met wonen waarom zou je mensen dan voortrekken met belastingkorting die toevallig uit het buitenland komen? Iedereen gelijk behandelen is toch niet meteen een reden om te verhuizen? ASML wil doolgraag betalen, aangezien ze onbeperkt geld hebben. Het probleem is dat de politiek Nederland zo erg verpest heeft, dat er niks meer gedaan kan worden. Een groei industrie moet uitbreiden, en als deze uitbreidingen jaren duren en met veel moeite gaan, denkt een bedrijf ook wel beter. Voor Nederland is ASML essentieel, voor ASML is Nederland van geen enkele waarde. Als van 30% naar 20% onbelast (op een vaak al riant) salaris al een probleem oplevert om expats te strikken, wat zegt dat over de belastingdruk op Jan Modaal?  Het idee dat grote bedrijven zo makkelijk regeringen kunnen gijzelen is gewoon lachwekkend . Men had dit ook gewook kinnen tegenhouden vanuit de overweging voor de nationale veiligheid . Men had dit ook gewoon kunnen tegenhouden vanuit de overweging voor de nationale veiligheid. Hoe werkt dat in de praktijk?  ASML is niet alleen het behouden van ASML maar ruimte bieden om hier te groeien absoluut in het landsbelang . Arbeidsmigratie is geen vies woord, Engelse studies moeten behoudens worden . Nederland is al jaren bezig om het vestigingsklimaat voor grote bedrijven kapot te maken. Omdat we zogenaamd meer solidair moeten zijn en moeilijk doen over grote inkomensverschillen. Hopelijk dat nu meer mensen inzien dat dit soort bedrijven en hun goed verdienend personeel van belang zijn om onze sociale voorzieningen te bekostigen. Toegegeven in NL is het allemaal niet heel stabiel op dit moment maar dan zou je naar FR willen verhuizen? Daar is het nog tien keer erger! Geen politieke stabiliteit, geen mensen die engels praten en een overheid die de regels om de twee miinuten aanpast. Wat zou de reden voor ASML zijn om daar naartoe te verhuizen? Ja, waarom zou je naar Nigeria verhuizen he? Dat gebeurt dus ook niet. Duitsland. Daar kunnen ze zo naartoe. Carl Zeiss zit er al. Trumpf ook. Praktisch de helft van die machine komt al uit Duitsland. Talloze goede technische universiteiten. Een bevolking die tenminste nog wat exacte vakken leert, een overheid die heel graag de chipindustrie wil ontwikkelen en een geweldig klimaat voor de maakindustrie. If those who missed out on Nvidia flock to AMD AMD will probably surpass 500 easily Its cozy Haha Just stop dropping Please Kabinet werkt aan plan om vertrek ASML uit Nederland te voorkomen Economie Het zou economische zelfmoord zijn als bedrijven als ASML zouden vertrekken Het enige bedrijf dat nog van enige relevantie is voor de wereldeconomie Hoeveel belasting betaald asml?

Asml vertrekt niet.. zeggen ze zelf ook ?ㅇ?띯셽截?dus wat loopt dat kabinet nou te janken. Komen we ook wel weer overheen. ASML gaat natuurlijk niet weg uit Nederland. Ze zitten in verschillende landen en dat blijft zo. Hoe groot ze worden of blijven in Nederland hangt natuurlijk erg van de lokale omstandigheden af.  Het College van Bestuur heeft daarop geantwoord: dat is volkomen gekkenwerk als er niet gelijktijdig navenante groei is aan woonruimte voor werknemers en studenten .

This is the post that made me finally check my history. I sold off 32 shares in September 2021. Every way I look at it though, there's no way I would have held it until now. Most of the year beyond that point was it losing value. Once it finally hit the green again, I would have dumped it. Been riding since 600 ?뮞 The FOMO is killing me You're not alone, usually its when i start feeling the FOMO that I know I should NOT enter. Learned the hard way. Should have followed Nancy Pelosi Should have bought it I bought yesterday and its already up 3% I hate this man??$NVDA I bought shitty ass google and coulda bought this stock.. Alright boys and girls, I'm going all in on NVDA. Enough sitting on the sidelines. Prepare for an NVDA crash. I always have the worst timing. Consider yourselves warned. ASML may be looking to leave the Netherlands ??but the Dutch government is desperate to keep it there: Report I'd imagine not just the Dutch govt but EU will be desperate to keep such a crucial asset in Europe. They're just looking to expand, not leave. Could build a new factory in another EU country like Germany for instance. I'd imagine Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and the US would be other options. China would certainly give them anything they ask for.. but only to insert spies and steal their IP so that's probably not gonna happen. PS: I basically see this as a no-brainer and think it would be overly protectionist for the EU to try and stop them. TSMC, Samsung and Intel all have fabs in multiple nations and its not unreasonable to expect ASML to also want to be in multiple locations. Could they not just declare it a matter of national security and force it to stay? Notably, the article mentioned that ASML is not looking to leave, but to expand and diversify their location. They also the mentioned the main reason is disagreement over Dutch gov policy. So there are easier option of simply offering a special deal with ASML for them to stay in Netherland. Also 40% of employee aren't Dutch local, that means they can leave for competiors or set up shop elsewhere. I'm sure there are plenty of investors willing to fund such programme. Most likely would have to offer large subsidies, take a large equity position, or outright nationalize if they want to force them to stay. None of those are good options. A significant portion of ASML's workforce, about 40%, consists of labor migrants. It's important to remember stuff like this when people insist tech should be unilaterally controlled by any one nation. End of the day, a country hosting so many labor migrants can and should do everything they can to naturalize those people and turn them into domestic permanent workers. The US for example does this extremely well. It's easy bro just cut taxes Quite the coincidence that most offices of the company that makes photolithography machines are located in the countries that have have the biggest semiconductor companies TBH what stops them from coming to the USA? Ah so frustrating Ah my money is gone crazy Ahead of the earnings Seems like the biggest drop in recent times Bear case on NVDA? What is the bear case for NVDA? Many people are saying that AI is a bubble and that NVDA and the rest of the AI stocks will pop soon. Is there any merit to this stance? I get that the stock has gone up a lot but i believe that this company has the proper infrastructure to take advantage of AI in the near future. Appreciate all comments and insight.  I have heard people compare AI to the dot com bubble . IMO, There will be lots of consolidation, new competition and likewise AI companies that go under . A key difference with a company like NVDA is that they are already profitable . The only real bear case for the long term is if they become complacent like IBM, Intel, or heck even Google now. As long as Jensen and team are in charge, I don?셳 think they will slip.  NVDA is massively overvalued based on sales, but is actually cheap based on earnings . The biggest bear case is their ability to post such insane margins . If anything comes along to bring their margins down, their valuation will start to look absurd and it will sell off . Could be competition, regulation, management risk (Jensen dies), or they could enjoy being on this rocket ship for many years to come. They said this at $150 and $200 and $300. Then they said it at $400. But then the q2,q3, and q4 results dropped?쫆nd now here we are. I remember (as a mod) this subreddit was full of dog shit from SeekingAlpha and MotleyFool ?쏿nalysts??saying this stock was over priced or heading to $50, and the usual shorters who perpetuated the garbage. Wow guess what? Since the split in 2021, the stock has essentially been going up. No one knows what will happen in the future but the regards saying it?셲 gonna pop now also said that for the past 3 years. Keep that in mind  I?셶e been holding since 2015. I grew up buying Nvidia and ATI video cards to play pc games with. When I got into college and had an internship, I dumped a truckload of my pay into Nvidia cause I knew they were onto something. If I sell today, I will be a millionaire. But since I? Well, one thing I see is that the PEG is currently 2.0 and the 3-5 year forecast is 36% (per year). Which suggests that almost three years' future growth is built into the current price. However, other stocks have much higher PEGs with less promise of growth. And the 36% growth projection is likely to change over time; it does with most stocks. I only have one stock (LRN) where the growth projection never seems to change. The main bear case scenario I have is the possibility that AI models don?셳 evolve much giving room for other big tech companies to easily launch custom ASICs for inference. The reason Nvidia is so successful is because their hardware is highly programmable (great software stack) and general enough to work with changing models. First it was CNNs and RNNs and other DNNs and evolved to include transformers.  There were dozens of AI chip startups over the last several years but why haven't been competitive? Because many of them are less programmable and focused on being better than Nvidia at current models (i.e., ASICS) So if we stick with transformers for a long while and it doesn?셳 evolve much, then custom ASICs will be a lot easier for these larger companies to build in-house and deploy, especially for inference. It?셲 also very likely open standards will emerge to compete with CUDA, shared among several manufacturers. Disagree. CUDA's success comes from it's wide adoption, probably somewhere on the order of 5M developers are currently using. Any alternative has to provide equal or better than utility than CUDA, and then it has a chance of becoming widely adopted if there is a decent hardware compliment. Accelerators are unique, not general purpose machines (like changing CPUs from Intel to AMD). So each one has a tuning a cycle that, if history repeats, takes years to get right. Intel's OpenAPI attempted to be all things to all accelerators has has gotten exactly no where apart from Intel own chips. And to take it one step further, Nvidia's solution is a platform. An analogy would be like trying to replace iOS on the iphone with an open source product. slim to no chance of that ever happening. The idea open standards are ""very likely"" to emerge is logical, but on the ground reality is in opposition. Competitors have had 8 years to make a dent in the cuda space and they still haven't despite chasing the prize of huge margins. And every day no Nvidia competitor shows up is another day Nvidia becomes more deeply entrenched. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92VcmkUA_gA  Wall Street waking up to what they didn't realize and gradually correcting their prior misvaluation . If interest rates start to fall, you will see stocks surge even more (non-AI) as people start investing the $7 TRILLION in cash sitting on the sidelines . This will drive AI stocks even higher . But the bear case would be governments around the world outlawing AI. Or someone inventing a device better than a GPU. Both of these are extremely low probability at this point. If there were a better way to do AI Jensen would have come up with it. Calls going to the moon!!!!

Honest question. Most reasonable people understand that this is a spesific and highly specialized area of work, and facilitating them is a strategic interest. My guess is they want to keep everything but expand in USA and move hq there. It has nothing to do with taxes (wink wink). The company had submitted several requests to the government and had mentioned France as a possible destination for expansion, the paper noted. at least they want stay within europe This company paid almost 800 million in profit tax alone in 2022. This would be a massive blow and should be avoided at all costs. EU should try to stop them leaving as well And that is just this company. Our entire region works either direct or indirect for ASML or their Tier 1 suppliers. It should be trivially easy for highly educated engineers and researchers to immigrate to EU. There literally aren't enough of these people in Europe, so the only option is to hire foreign labour. If that's made too difficult by byzantine immigration laws, ASML doesn't really have any other choice than to expand outside of Europe. CEO criticized the 30% tax ruling decision. His concern, it seems, is that if they can't expand in NL and do it somewhere else, then at one point it may become an option to leave NL. I read the ""ongoing talks with the cabinet"" part but I am not certain how these talks would address CEO's concern. An even more special tax regime for the expats working for ASML? No way this would happen. Reversal of the decision on the 30% rax ruling? I don't know.  I think he is trying to change the minds of politicians and the people to create support for increased highly skilled migration, making that easier, and keeping the 30% ruling . Feels more like a public lobbying call. Europe can turn into a big outdoor museum. If you missed the NVDA train, buy ARM Summary: I fully expect Nvidia and Jensen Huang to go after ARM and acquire a (rather large) stake at any moment, possibly as soon as lockup expires next week. If Trump wins election and FTC changes leadership, Nvidia will likely try to acquire ARM outright.  Nvidia announced plans to acquire ARM from Softbank for $40 billion . FTC sues to block the merger citing anti-competitive advantages the combined firm would do in the AI race . On February 2022, Nvidia and Softbank announce the termination of Nvidia acquitition of ARM Holdings . ARM would IPO in September of 2023 .  All the major tech companies in the world (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, META, Tesla, and many many others) are working to design their own chips, most are based on ARM architecture . Jensen Huang sees the writing on the wall . If Nvidia was successful in acquiring ARM back in 2021, those $40 billion NVDA shares would be worth $220 billion to Softbank today if we go by the 10x valuation metric that both Nvidia and Softbank likely agreed upon back in 2020.

Intel shares biggest unboxing video ever as ASML?셲 $380 million High-NA lithography machine is installed in Oregon fab. https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intel-shares-biggest-unboxing-video-ever-as-asmls-dollar380-million-high-na-lithography-machine-is-installed-in-oregon-fab Late last year, ASML began shipping its first high-NA extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system to Intel, and this past weekend, the processor giant published a video covering the installation of the tool into its fab near Hillsboro, Oregon. The machine will be used primarily for research and development purposes. ASML's Twinscan EXE:5000 High-NA EUV machine is indeed absolutely massive. In total, 250 crates are required to transport the machine, which weighs in the neighborhood of 330,000 pounds. A cargo plane transported the container in the video from The Netherlands to Portland, Oregon, and then a truck delivered one of the key components of the tool. As you can see in the video below, the unit has been installed at the fab, but it will take 250 ASML and Intel engineers about six months to install the machine completely. Next unboxing video - 2030 - hyper NA machine. The fact someone sells and installs this blows my tiny fucking mind. Human engineering and ingenuity at its finest. Had no idea intel was a fan of Ocean's Eleven. Lakes are pretty popular around here. I guess oceans are the next logical step. How much does shipping and insurance cost? it's free delivery with amazon prime If you fuck up, you're out of business. Did they release benchmark results? It will be really interesting if they manage to get High-NA machines working on a good schedule. If they manage that, they will have leapfrogged TSMC by one machine generation. I'd like to see Linus drop it Three Hundred Eighty Million!!! Omg! Get Intel?셲 engineers on the phone! They had no idea the cascadia earthquake was a risk! Good thing we have redditors here to inform them! Right, because Taiwan, South Korea and Japan are immune to earthquakes. If Cascadia goes then we'll have much worse problems, like Seattle and Portland being underwater. Yup, like clockwork. Every chip fab story will be accompany by a comment about water supply. You must be fun at parties. Have you considered the diminishing water supplies are caused by these manufacturing plants (as well as various forms of farming, like Cotton and Alfalfa farming) Isnt the expectation too high No food at a famous banquet MRVL & MDB earnings tonight. Last shot for riches Woopsie I shit the bed again hihihihi It's the 4th quarter right now, where champions are made, where destinies are determined. Let's finish this season strong baby. Am I the only one who is sensing a deja vu moment right now? LMND & AAP (0/2) -> SNOW, AI & PARA (3/3)??? Today Ive got 2 companies that I?셪l be gambling on, they both report right after the bell today: Marvell Technology & MongoDB.  I'm getting ARM vibes off this one, one of my favorite movies is Avengers Infinity War . They got a dwarf playing a dwarf on a dwarf planet; now that's called good writing . Earnings are gonna be marvelous tonight boys .  Software/cloud companies keep getting slaughtered after earnings . MongoDB is a software company, and we all know what that means . CRWD was Wall Street's dark horse to save the industry . TLDR: MRVL goes up, MDB goes down My positions: God bless America Not financial advice Join WSB Discord Your prediction scorecard: I?셫 1/6 following him. I?셫 the true regard Nice You son of a bitcx! Now I might have to pull out my calls before ER to inverse you Mrvl mentions Ai and nvda on their website. I think that is a good sign. You, sir, can go fuck yourself. 0/2 following you. The premiums are too damn fkn high I love Marvel movies, I'm in! Loading up on 3/15 90C Sir you owe me $840 Idk looking at MRVL?셲 financials, they bring in a shit load of money but they?셱e still in the red. I?셪l put $500 in it and see what happens but this is officially me saying this is probably a bad idea but fuck it, lets hope this stock takes off to planet dwarf I bought 20k worth Don?셳 you dare fuck up my MRVL calls! I?셶e had them since last week and I?셶e almost tripled my money! sell before earnings Sum of a bi***! Im in Even after that CRWD loss??oof that one hurt ?삛 I hate you for MRVL calls you sir made me very poor One right one wrong, but I bought MRVL call and didn?셳 buy MDB put Please stop posting ?솋 MDB is no F1 sponsor, Oracle, Cloudstrike are, those 2 gained, other software companies that didn't sponsor F1 went tits up, so OP is right with this one, MDB will go down Netherlands seeks to prevent ASML expansion abroad, report says Nonzero chance ?쫭?쫭?쫭 eventually becomes asml hq Headline makes it sound like ASML wants to expand abroad and the government is trying to prevent that. In actuality ASML prefers to expand within NL but the housing shortage and increasingly xenophobic electorate envious of tech expats is making that harder. So the government has to find a way to accommodate ASML expansion despite these issues.  ASML basically multiplies the strategic importance of the Netherlands by several magnitudes . Kinda makes sense from the Dutch POV tbh. No country would like to share the technology from such a strategic sector . Economic policy L. Let companies expand....shouldn't it be a source of national pride to have a company native to the nation spreading internationally. That's a national security issue. There are few other companies in the world which have such a Monopoly as ASML. Actually I can't think of one. Newer to investing, can stocks like NVDA really keep going higher? I understand the average investor moves the market so little and it?셲 probably massive orders coming in but isn?셳 there psychological appeal to having a stock price not at almost $1,000 a share? Like will there be a point in 10 years (potentially) that NVDA is at like $1,700 a share and now will look like a bargain price? Is there a way to reduce their price but keep the same value? They will instantly drop just after you buy them. Prices are magnetically drawn away from whatever movement you hope to see. Buy shares, prices go down. Buy puts, prices go up. Buy calls, prices go down. Straddle a position, prices run flat. There really isn't a very hard ceiling on share price, especially among big tech. Amazon, Google, Tesla, etc. have all broken through that territory. If it gets too high to trade efficiently, there are always stock splits. I don't have a current position in NVDA but 1k per share or more wouldn't surprise me at all. All time highs are broken constantly. Apple is a good example of a stock that has breached ATH's many times despite constant questions of whether a stock could continue that type of growth. I have the same Qs as you 10+ years ago when looking at META, APPL, AMZN and other tech stocks. Guess where they are now. Nobody knows what it will do. Everybody here is speculating. What I do know is FOMO will lose you money. There will be more opportunities and more stocks that go flying over the years. You don?셳 have to make it all right now Put it this way.  If people know 100% for sure that NVDA will be $1700 in 10 years, they would buy so much NVDA today so that NVDA?셲 price today is boosted to $1700. I think it would be $1700 less the US treasury rate over 10 years, but your point still stands isn?셳 there psychological appeal to having a stock price not at almost $1,000 a share? Heard of BRK-A? Nobody knows. I know this isn?셳 your point, but NVDA at $1700 in 10 years would be a disappointing (for NVDA) 7% annual growth rate and no longer a market leader/maker.

You'd be up 100%. Another day, another shill post about TSM and why they are THE CHOSEN ONES. Rolled by 140Cs into the 145s at 4/19 as they are now ITM. This shit is gonna keep running. Some SemiWiki finds: TSMC President ""There is no way to compete with TSMC."" Customer trust is very important. We know. That is why we full ported. You can't replace the consistency and results that TSMC has delivered over the years. The US is subsidizing domestic production and Intel/Samsung want to catch up, but this will take years to realize. Arrogant or confident? Wei wrote a book called ""Only The Paranoid Survive."" TLDR: I think Wei is a dawg. I want this chad on my team. Semiwiki User - TSMC was chosen for ease of development + execution. Intel and Samsung may not succeed against TSMC and he thinks their chances are less than 50%. We know. Competition is good, but I simply do not believe in the execution of Intel and Samsung. TLDR: They picked TSMC b/c of ease of development + execution. TBD if other foundries can prove themselves. This is my personal take on Intel and Samsung talent. Intel is a retirement home of boomer hardware engineers. Samsung is nepo-baby central, everyone I know who works or worked there is some rich korean who had a network. TLDR: Talent level at competition is meh. Semiwiki User - ""Why TF is Intel building a foundry and will you give Intel dibs on production? If semi demand drops, they are fucked!"" Yes, they will probably give themselves priority on production. They also need to prove themselves and gain the trust of customers when they launch (see President Wei's point), which will take time. TLDR: INTC tides are turning in their favor short term. Subsidies and record demand. Will get fucked if demand ever drops + still needs to prove themselves.

Connected world economy = all need to work together. Success of TSMC = success of the West and America. I DID BUY WHEN YOU TOLD ME TOOOOO HALLELUJAH. In beepboopthrowaway i trust ?솈?뤋?솈?뤋?솈?뤋 I will never sell my TSM calls (but like over the weekend tho??) I'm only holding off because the moment I buy in, Taiwan will be invaded by China. So really I'm just trying to prevent WW3 Hello 800% gains. I have been telling this sweet TSM Bro, delete this until I can load up on calls You had all of yesterday bozo Believing in TSMC is believing in America Thank you AMD Love you Thanks AMD for making me feel like a king. I was always forced to be budget conscious and my family had humble beginnings. My PCs were aimed at best bang for the buck. K6-2, Celeron, i3-2130, then my last CPU was an used i7-3770). My GPUs were the likes of 1060 6gb throughout time. 7800X3D is so accessible. For me it was the famous microcenter bundle with 32gb ddr5 and mobo and CPU for $469 (Still active now). I mean this thing beats it trades blows with intel's top of the line i9-14900k. But as we know, the top of the line performance is cheap because you can slap on a $25 air cooler and less PSU demand, etc. This CPU is amazing. It feels great seeing benchmark reviewers and tech sites use my same processor for testing. It scratches that itch since Ive always had budget rigs. There are many things I'm grateful for in life. This is just gaming, but it's awesome. I have a feeling this processor will age well similar to 5800x3d and kind of like 1080 ti. I'll always remember this CPU. 7800X3D is so accessible. For me it was the famous microcenter bundle with 32gb ddr5 and mobo and CPU for $469 (Still active now). This still annoys me every time I see it. 7800x3d is $500 by itself in Canada, and our cheapest bundle with mobo and RAM is $800. Its basically not even a deal when you add up the parts individually. $500 CAD? That's $370 USD which is what the 7800X3D costs for us non-microcenter folks in the US 7800x3d is $500 by itself in Canada 500 CAD is 370 USD. They might use the same sign, but they're not the same. It's the exact same price as in the US Cuz we don't have Microcenter. Bro what? That's like half the f* asking price over here. Jesus you're lucky. I got a 5800x3d around 6 months ago and love it. But for that bang for buck I wouldn't even think twice. Microcenter is great, they have a bundle for 5800x3d and the 7700x also. I think $320 for the 5800x3d with a decent board and 16gb of ram.  It's a bit premature to say the 5800x3d ""aged well"", the processor only came out April 2022, so isn't even 2 years old yet . The chip was released to support people on the AM4 platform . The 1080 ti came out in 2017, so I think it's more appropriate to call that out as ""aged well"". Hell, I recently upgraded to Ryzen 9 7900 from a i7-2600 from 15 years ago - that i7-2600 also aged well. I suspect that 5800x3d and 7800x3d will both age well, but again, seems premature to label them as such just yet. I still fondly remember heating my room with my fx-8350 Damn I wish I could get a bundle for that price in Australia. The cost of that bundle is the same as just the CPU here :( Nothing like an unironic ""thank you AMD"" post in a supposed non-circlejerk sub. Corporations don't care about you, aren't your friend. Hey congratulations I love that 7800x3d best decision I've ever made This is such a weird post. I'm happy you're happy about your product, but this is just fucking weird, lol. It's a billion dollar company. This reads like you had chatGPT make some sob story, lol. Thank microcenter in general. I got the 12900k bundle from there for $400 and I also feel like a king. Yeah I got a 13700k bundle for about $600. Microcenter bundles are genuinely phenomenal. Think I would've been spending about $200 more without them. Definitely will be shopping with them again. 7800x3d is expensive where i live. Adding a mobo + ram sticks will cost almost US$1000 here. got an 7800x3D, coming from an i5-4570, the upgrade was quite brutal This is how i feel about the 12600kf just blows my mind that for 145 usd i got a monster of a cpu that will trade productivity blows with that 7800x3d of yours. You seem like you forgot that people build PCs to be used for more than just gaming. These Microcenter posts are getting old. The invincible NVDA and Jensen Huang! I?셶e never seen a company dominate its industry like NVDA and a CEO like Jensen Huang. Love the man, the company and the stock!! NVDA made me $3.5 mil from $50K in less than 1.5 months!!! Can someone tell me what jacket Jensen wears?삚! Very true, it sure is life changing.. took out 75% as profits.. never know what happens in market.. How did you do it? with calls? Yes, but I won?셳 suggest anyone to take such risks unless you?셱e prepared to lose everything, literally.  Last year also I made about $2.7m in a month but made a mistake of not taking profits at right time and market crashed after hours . What works for one person may not work for another . Nice gains. And yes, everybody has a different risk tolerance. Not saying you didn't work for your money but I wonder how a normal person would feel seeing million dollar swings. Options be crazy! not just the CEO...we are getting to get behind the Founder.

By the way... Intel in Talks for More Than $10 Billion in Chips Act Incentives In AI Era INTEL is national tresaure. Hidden gem. Join WSB Discord I think INTC is an interesting turnaround play but the amount of bullish posts about it makes me wary INTC is a turnaround play without a turnaround price Intel is like that one ugly girl in school who got potential I've been on Facebook, most of them still ugly just sayin I always put a paper bag over my 8nm fabs and pretend they are 4nm fabs. Sigh... They never learn They don't, but I think there's some merit to Intel now. They've dumped the MBA CEO, returned to focusing on solving hard problems, they've cut the silly side businesses, like mobile modems and they're opening their fabs for business. They've got work to do - they actually need to execute on their plans; but they've lost the things that were actively sabotaging them. Citing a desire to power next gen gaming consoles is a fucking sign of weakness. They're some of the lowest margin chips to sell. It's a great way to keep their fabs busy because no one wants their high profit data center shit. AMD got into consoles when the company was on life support and they were chained to GlobalFoundries for massive wafer purchases when no one wanted to buy their dogshit CPUs. They almost went bankrupt during that whole episode and honestly if Zen1 flopped in 2017 they would be gone right now. Meanwhile WSB like ""Intel is trying to spin off its fabs and take on low margin bulk sales of silicon"" like it's some kind of bullish thing and we haven't seen this play out before. Why does it rise and why does it fall Why do you keep shaking my heart Why is the US market like this today folks Is it a war",-6

Het is het dus een beetje alsof je het bedrijf dat het onder Maar de expatregeling, die belastingvoordelen voor werknemers uit het buitenland betekent, wordt afgebouwd waardoor het voor bijvoorbeeld ingenieurs uit India financieel minder aantrekkelijk is om in Nederland aan de slag te gaan.

Terecht omdat het niet eerlijk is en omdat het door bepaalde bedrijven werd aangewend als excuus om sommige mensen (meestal uit India) 30% minder te betalen dan de Nederlanders die hetzelfde werk deden. Ik denk dat een compromis heel simpel is.

Can?셳 wait to see $86+ tomorrow Need $94 Congrats, probably going to end up green with the buyback. It is a victory if you took the 90k or even close to your comfort point and let the rest go as it will. everything is bounces back rn those will prolly print You got greedy and didn?셳 sell for 75k gains, right? Congrats, fuck you. Let's not call victory yet ?삲 ?쁻 ?? Bro is about to be down massive lol. pigs get slaughtered I think you will be ok on the 75 calls Welcome to Wendy's People are optimistic because of the stock repurchase and the projected increases in the data center market. The reaction was due to lower earning projections for Q1, but they said that they will get back up in Q2. Holy shit bro you gotta sell half right before close next time. Lesson learned Is this Cho Byungjin Our Samjeon is Marvell Technologies (MRVL) gains, diamond hands I'm sure many of you have read about the potential of MRVL's AI data centers. Regarding their AI data centers, the company had initial guidance on their last ER of ~$400M revenue in Q4 2023. An update on their estimate is now ~$750M, a 50% increase! If this is not enough to persuade you, they just extended their partnership with TSMC this morning at 9 a.m. EST. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/marvell-announces-industrys-first-2nm-platform-for-accelerated-infrastructure-silicon-302082510.html YoY, they are estimating a decrease of ~30% in networking (we regards know most of the networking companies ER's guidance have been poor), ~36% decrease in telecom, ~20% decrease in automobile. In order to combat this, the company has shored up these three areas by decreasing production and getting rid of inventory. To conclude, I expect them to meet expectations, but their guidance will be phenomenal. Scared money, makes no money. ?뭿 ?몢 Join WSB Discord Sorry this post didn't age well dude. Holding thru earnings later today G? ?뭿?몢 Holding though earnings call !!! 90/c !!! I?셫 getting fucked! I am in. They beat earnings and estimates 75% or three out of four. Just made $17k on AVGO. Bought after popping adderall. Are you ready? This is usually how ?뭿?솈?뤋plays out In. Let's ride Fuck... Guh :(
I am still up on it but damn. Fucking MRVL they are going to zero if it doesn't rise fast, 85 is far off, march 15 is near Hahaha look at all the ?ㄱ who downvoted me saying I was going to sell half my contracts before close. Well I did and I?셫 sitting pretty now! at 400 a call who tf can even afford to get in now Guh You got smoked. How did this turn out Should I put my house down? Does your broker accept trailers? NVDA is not a bubble I swear. Join WSB Discord Does anyone think it will hit $1100 soon? like soon do you mean by morning? Can those other companies make hardware that does this? No matter what you think about any of those companies: why don't you have market cap as a factor on this sheet ? This needs more upvotes. Price per share is irrelevant. ?ㄳ Wtf is this revenue shit? It IS a bubble. But sometimes bubbles don?셳 burst for years. So I have no idea what to do. If you just been watching from 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, soon 1000+ at least you can tell your grandkids you got to witness it. I can tell my grandkids I thought 490 was too high to buy and we can all cry together in front of the tire fire. NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock - Wait? or Sell? I don't invest much. but bought NVDA 2 years ago ..and well, it grew from 200ish USD to 900ish USD. In the last year, I've been mostly investing in ETFs like VOO just because I don't follow business/investing news too much and ETFs seem easy. Anyway, I'm wondering if I should just sell all my NVDA (15 stocks) and purchase VOO or SMH. Or do people think that this upward trend with NVDA will continue? I have a few other stocks like Apple, Microsoft, etc that I bought years ago and haven't touched since.  I decided to hold for a longer time, since I don't really need the cash for anything now . I will continue to focus on the tech trends and the stock price changes and change my plans if I see it dip more than what I'm comfortable . I used to have a dozen or so shares of NVDA. Now I only have 3 shares left. While I wish I still had them all, I don't blame myself for taking some profits along the way. At this point, I'm going to hold onto my last 3 for a while. I sold 150 shares for 200 dollars a little over a year ago. It hurts so bad right now?셲. 900 seems like a lot, I think it?셲 a good place to sell for profits, but, how would I know? I was the idiot that sold at 200. If in a non taxable account, I see reasons to sell and buy index for the sake of being conservative. If it's taxable, I'd be leaning towards holding for a bit more. This AI boom is likely gonna go on for a few more years until company can capitalize (or not)on the this AI uprising. I mean, if it drops to 800 will you really be that upset? And on the other side, if you sell but it keeps growing, are you going to be kicking yourself? There?셲 no right answer here it?셲 whatever you prefer. I?셫 personally holding cause I got in at $90 so even if it does drop 20% overnight (unlikely) I?셪l still be up over 700%  I bought $8k of Apple in 2002 as a college student . I sold it off here and there to buy other great companies like Amazon, Google, etc. I also bought some losers . Would I have more money now? Sure . But it was a good move from a risk management POV . ""No one ever went broke taking profits."" -- My guiding investment philosophy Sold 50 today cost basis $5.26/share nobody knows man. could crash tomorrow down 20%. could keep rising through 1000 and beyond. eventually you will have to pull the trigger yourself. if you are worried and cant handle the risk, then yes, selling and going back to VOO is fine. personally, i sold 1/3 of my stake before earnings. still holding all the rest, still planning to hold for a while longer. when/if nearing 1000 ill keep an eye on the charts and judge momentum. if at any point it sells off 10-20% ill probably sell and wait for it to settle and get back in later. When talking about a single stock you really have to think what you're asking about and why NVDA's stock price is so high. It is very high because recent quarterly earnings have shown a massive increase in demand for NVIDIA's AI chips. Based on this + how much tech is hyping AI-related shit, the Market thinks the demand will only grow. All it takes is for the market to get bored and plateau on AI, or for a comparable AI-chip competitor to reign in NVDA's massive profit margin. NVDA for now holds a pretty good monopoly on majority of AI chips just by being first to market in a certain way. It depends on which future you think is more probable vs your risk vs reward aversion. It's much more probable the NVDA will drop 20% than VOO will drop 20%, but the upside of NVDA is probably higher than the short-term upside of VOO. So the question is: How much do you care if you lose the money you have in NVDA? If not a lot, you can keep it... If you feel like you can't afford to lose it, diversify. I have NVDA in shares and in several mutual funds, one of which is a semiconductor sector fund that holds 27% in NVDA so there was some cushion.  I had a price-to-sell point in mind before I bought shares, which was $400 . At $400, I took enough profit to cover my cost basis, then set another sell point at $700 . Today it closed over $900, and J Powell had encouraging remarks about lowering Fed rates . EDIT - Boy, the numbers don't lie. Buy the ticket, take the ride. https://i.imgur.com/KzCJM1M.jpg If you don't need the money, why not just hold? See what happens at $1000 tomorrow Or $1500 by June Let the winners run This is how I lost buttloads of Ks on a stock. Should have sold when it went up 30%. Edit: though I'm long on NVDA Wait until GTC conference at least starts (it runs march 18 to 21). I suspect the market is anticipating a big announcement at the conference. If the announcement ends up being lack luster, nvidia will sell off. It is my OPINION that nvidia will overall rise for this year. But obviously, I have no insights that no one else has. If you?셱e uncomfortable with holding an individual stock, by all means sell and reallocate.  The only time to sell a company you bought as an investment is when you find another company that you believe is a better value at the current price than the one you are holding . A smart investor would sell the ""overvalued"" stock and buy the undervalued one .  If you're not a trader, and you don't aspire to be, you should not be moving your positions too often . If you are more active, you can rebalance your portfolio more often, but there is a very fine line between trading and investing .  I strongly believe that you can't go wrong taking profits at these prices as long as you are moving the money into something you think is a better value . When I sell a company, I don't like to sell my entire position as it lets me keep an eye on the price . I only ever buy companies in my investment account that I'm Good luck. Sell half and keep half Buy more. This is a once in a lifetime company. Praying for performance and Meta If you press like Earningsurf Seems like an earnings miss Slowly rises only when theres low trading volume and big money runs away Stop loss on NVDA? I've got 191 shares at $144, so obviously fkn happy rn. Curious if you all have any set stop losses, especially at this price? You?셱e up ~600%,why are you worried about stop loss at this point. This won?셳 matter in 10 years,when the price it?셲 at now will be considered a steal. Paranoia lol Wish I hadn?셳 on my 3/15 $800 calls a few days ago! I feel you bro. I considered cashing in my entire Roth IRA and buying March 15 $700C when NVDA was around $550. I did the math, and if NVDA hit $712, I'd have a million dollars. In order to get there I would have had to use my entire retirement account. And $700 felt sooo far away. I bought shares and a few calls things are pretty forking great. But had I gone all in on those March $700C Id be so rich.  I raised my stop loss at $905 this morning and it sold, I wanted to jump back in but I am going to do everything in my power not to let fomo win . The very same analyst that raised the price target this morning, an hour later was flagging the stock with concerns about the move this morning . You are so lucky! Which analyst you noticed? Any link please?  I personally don??�� use stop losses, but i?Â�� young and have time to be checking my stocks every day . I also like to sell when I want to, and often rather hold on a dip than sell . Options are up like over 600% this week. I don?셳 get stock when it moves obviously fast and up. Missing out.

SEMI NEWS Intel stands to win US$3.5 billion to produce chips for military (link) We are trying to domesticate chips. Subsidies for chip manufactures! Some critique is that we are subsidizing older chips and not exactly bleeding edge. ""If the CHIPs act was at least honest that they don?셳 care about leading edge, and say it is all about on-shoring essential chips and military hardware I would get it. But frequently they talk like getting the leading edge stuff is the main part of it. TLDR: WE WILL SEE WHICH COMPANIES ARE GETTING THE SUBSIDIES AT THE END OF MARCH. BET ON YOUR SEMI HORSES ACCORDINGLY. Microsoft's new Surface laptops will be available with Arm CPUs in June (link) Lmao. Personal opinion - Intel CPUs are mid and thats why Apple uses ARM.

I have puts on intc for January $35 my 50C 03/15 isnt looking hopefull today but hoping a week long enough to bounce a bit 1/17/25 $75 Call . Got in at 0.61 with 2 contracts letting it ride until INTC explodes What to buy while waiting for NVDA pullback? I sold all my NVDA stock last week of February (due to written call options being executed at $785). Since I still strongly believe in NVDA long term, I plan to buy them back on the next pullback.. I just wont allow myself to sell low, buy high.. Since NVDA represented around 30% of my portfolio, I have quite a bunch of cash sidelined now.. What would you recommend to invest this in, given my plan to reinvest this amount in NVDA within the next year? I've been waiting for a pullback since it was in the $400's. That strategy didn't work out well. We had a strong pullback 2 days ago at +0.86%. Rookie mistake not to buy then. People have been making posts like this since it was $4-500/share I sold at $430 and waited for a pull back to $838 to buy it back. My sorry ass selling at $275 only to jump back in at $700 It got to a point where I'm convinced it's not going anywhere anytime soon. It's gonna reach dum dum levels and then they'll split the stock. and then the stock split will be bullish too LMAO I don't see a pull back anytime soon. Buy TSM instead idk lol One does not simply wait for an Nvidia pullback Waiting could be a while, it's going parabolic. Nvidia pullback? Lol. There has not been a time in recent years where NVDA stock didn't feel uncomfortable to buy at its price. Never. And every time I've done it I didn't like it. I once even sold a few shares when it went ""big"" (narrator's voice: ""It, in fact, did not go big... it kept going."") It will stop going up, perhaps very shortly, but at that time you will be shitting bricks about the economy so badly that you won't be buying. I'm thinking that that will be this summer. This stock is literally a flagpole. Very rarely do these patterns hold. Just give some patience, and scoop some up when its back in the 500s. I was waiting for a pull back since the 400s. Finally, I just got in there and haven't looked back. Up a decent percentage now and going to hold on for the inevitable split. Well, that's just me at least. TSM is a great value still. Very Taiwanese of them not to overcharge and keep happy customers Is the pullback in the room with us right now? I love people who think they're going to catch it on a pullback. What's the scenario that is going to scare everyone into selling but embolden you to pull the trigger and buy? I owned $NVDA since it was $54 per share and was told by many people that the tech bubble will happen. I am still buying. Man, this thread reads like a WSB thread about Tesla from 2020. When do you think NVDA will reach $2k? I think given everything we have seen so far, $2k is not outside the realm of possibility. Do you see it happening anytime soon? Assume, no split to keep things normalized. It needs to be at 5 trillion market cap to reach 2k per share, I don?셳 think It?셪l happen this year Split 4 to 1 at $1000
then do it AGAIN at the next $1000 go around IT WILL HAPPEN...
FYI that is 16X on your current position NVIDIA is the ""BEAR and PUT OPTION"" SLAYER Interesting. Jensen should do the split a few times over to pump up the price. I think it might happen in the next two months. Nothing can stop NVDA, I've bet my house on it. This would be amazing! You think in 2 months, really? imo i think they split before that happens As I mentioned, we are talking in terms of pre-split price to keep things comparable. Folks voting ""Never"", what's your reasoning? Isn?셳 that a $5 Trillion company at 2k a share? Almost twice the size of Apple? Seems far fetched. Will it break through 100 If he becomes Trump he will be more of a country firstFlow that also turns legacySubsidies in the US should be given priority to domestic companiesIf you break through the white fire youll see Muju GongsanFrom now on more than Hanick Micron Maybe its better than Nvidia Will it keep going up Not selling even at 27 Psychological battle asml holdings and air NZ  Does anyone know why Asml is shooting up so much and will air NZ ever get back to its pre covid price? I currently have 1k in airnz and I?셫 down like 7% . Idk if I should just give up with airnz . and just buy something else . I bought 2k air nz and I am down 20% I also work for air nz, so I will work harder, so the share price goes back up Thank you God speed good sir I'm down a lot on Air NZ as well. The whole semiconductor and PC hardware industry has been popping off lately, look at NVIDIA for example, but even Intel, AMD, TSMC have all been doing well. ALL of them rely completely on ASML, and people have begun to realise that. They have no competition in a massive growth industry, and it would be extremely difficult for any competition to arise with how advanced the industry is. So that explains ASML. AirNZ is anybody's guess, they do have competition and with the general economy not feeling so great and people struggling to get by there are less people flying often. I'm still sitting on some AirNZ I got during covid lockdowns, not selling but not expecting it to pop off. Wow look at me I saw asml coming from miles away. But thanks probably will just hold air nz but would you say maybe putting some more into asml would be a relatively good idea or is it to late to jump in on the hype? That and AI this guys going off on YouTube ads that its the next big thing also. I currently have around 1.5k air nz and am continuing to buy more purely based on the fact that it is 51% govt owned and that it should never go under, they were slow getting back up post Covid which did allow competition to muscle in, maybe I?셫 regarded but I still think that it could go back up to around the dollar mark at some stage Stop buying this trash just go all in META. We are in an AI and inflation fuelled giga bubble and this is the fastest horse",18
2024-03-08,"Anyone who make money with options with NVDA? Looking to learn. Have 5k to throw and I want to call it to 1k. How do I do that? Where is a good place to learn? Oh boy. If you?셶e never tried options before, I would absolutely not recommend it with a stock as volatile as NVDA. You can get wiped out very quickly. To give you some context, I had nearly $20,000 of NVDA calls yesterday. I was up $8,000 on the day and it was wiped out in an instant. I luckily escaped with a $350 profit but that was only because I was watching it like a hawk and reacted very quickly to the downturn. Try some options on SPY first so you get a feel for how they work. Damn, 8k wasn't enough profit for you? Had an investment class at my college several years back. It had a description referencing the bogleheads... bruh, my professor was a straight options trading wizard.  First day of class, ""if you want to learn to be a less risky investor, here's the bogleheads book"" You can make a lot of money, but you can lose it all as well.""  As soon as the first crypto bubble popped he came in and said ""I'm not giving you financial advice, but if was you right now, I'd take all the spare money I have and buy nvdia. Dude bought 1000 shares of nvidia right then and there at $134 PRE SPLIT.... I think it was around June 2019  Started with 4 k last week ended with 11.3k on Friday morning . I have one call left but after Friday I don't know what to expect, if I were you I? DAMN DUDE Work on maxing out your ROTH IRA before you worry about options!!!!!! Maximum 5% of my portfolio is options. Either for hedging, if i think my stock goes down like AMDs earning report i shorted AMD. Or NVIDIA goes down like -5% the i buy option in hope it rises again in near future. Worked like 20x for me. With the gains i buy more NVIDIA long leveraged stock 3x and 2x. I want to buy more normal stock and 2x in future only because of the volatility. There is a great free course at options alpha. Be careful if you do not know what you are doing that 5k could be gone in a day. https://optionalpha.com/courses You missed the boat. You?셱e showing up as that pair of pants you like at the clothing store went from $25 to $125 and now deciding you want a pair yet at $25 you didn?셳 care about those pants. With nvidia, the premiums are huge right now. Volatility and time make options more costly. I?셶e had some gains here and there, but I?셫 mostly staying away from them right now. If you think it?셲 going to go up that much, you?셱e better off buying the stock or NVDL (a leveraged nvidia etf). You can also buy in-the-money options, which won?셳 have a premium, but cost more up front. Another safe-ish way to try to make some gains is to buy very OTM calls (lower premium) and sell if/when they become profitable but before they expire. Eg: buy $1200 calls, their intrinsic price goes up as the stock goes up (but goes down as the date approaches). The less safe but still reasonable way to get some options gains is to play the volatility, but that requires close observation. Eg: buy weekly calls when the stock dips, sell when it goes back up A riskier tactic is sell far out puts. If you think the stock won?셳 go below, say, $600 this year, you can sell puts for December. But if it goes to $600 you?셱e on the hook to buy the stock. This will require more money in your account and/or possibly higher options tier with your brokerage. However, if you?셶e never done any of this, you first need an investment account and approval to use options. And you probably need to lose money to get the feel for it. Just buy NVDX if you want something with more risk, it?셲 much easier than learning options.

Still the forecast is a 40 increase compared to last year Earnings decline Get out of here Earnings earnings surprise Good luck Expecting a positive opening US stocks dont joke around with just performance 
They dont mess around with market manipulation using inside information 
Broadcoms performance is good
Dumb retail investors throwing dumb stuff in the afterhours tsk tsk tsk From 8 to 4 Haha Going up with semiconductor Decline in semiconductor sales Good performance Whether the performance is bad or they dont cut interest rates
If they defend the stock price properly for a day or two they will aim for new highs again However support has been weak since the earnings announcement was made again US stock prices are really unpredictable Lets just wait and see for now I like the US because they are honest Following the performance Is Intel (INTC) Undervalued?  Intel has had a few rocky quarters in mid 2022 to mid 2023, but it seems like they could be also on the verge of a turn around . They recently signed a 15 billion dollar deal with Microsoft, and are currently in negotiations to make chips for the US military . Key stats for NVDA Yearly Revenue: 44.87B Net Income: 18.88B PE Ratio: 80 Net Assets/Shareholder Equity: 33.3B Market Cap: 2.38T Key stats for INTC Yearly Revenue: 54.23B Net Income: 1.69B PE Ratio: 114 Net Assets/Shareholder Equity: 110B Market Cap: 195B  Intel has more revenue, more shareholder equity, and 1/10 the market cap of NVDA . Their profitability took a huge hit in 2022, but their most recent quarters have seen them return to net positive . If the chip sector continues its rally then INTC could be a good bet . Does anyone have any information on Intel and why it might be so undervalued in comparison to other semiconductor stocks? Intel has a potential for a huge growth in 2025 and later, but they must do a lot of things right. They need to finish their 18A and 20A fabs, they need this fabs to be competitive in terms of production costs with tsmc, they need to design good competitive chips for AI and start producing them. So potentially a lot could wrong, like the fabs could be delayed, and then tsmc could catch up with intel, their fabs could be expensive to operate, or they might just design inferior chips, nvidia can put way more resources into r&d right now.  Intel seems fairly low risk if things go wrong, because the stock is so close to it's book value . If things go right I could see this stock very easily 2 or 3x in the next couple of years . My faith in Intel is not great at this point, but I'm holding a small position anyway . Comparing Intel to nvidia for these metrics won?셳 do justice as they are different businesses. NVDA PE isn?셳 926 btw Yes. Everything else aside, having a domestic fab is a matter of national security and they cannot be allowed to fail. The situation with China and Taiwan is a huge security risk for the US because chip capacity is arguably the most important source for maintaining world power and influence. Just because they can't be allowed to fail doesn't mean they are undervalued. Plenty of ""not allowed to fail"" businesses have had shareholder equity disintegrated. If you compare anything to nvidia of cours it's going to look undervalued. If they fail to pull off IDM2.0/IFS, yes they are overvalued.  If they pull it off, they'll be one of the most important companies in the world. Growth is all that matters The pitch on Intel is pretty simple. They are running the company now as 2 businesses, Fab and product.     Product division suffered due to Intel being behind TSMC for past 5-6 years. That will soon be over due to Intel being equal or ahead with 18A. Outside customers are signing onto 18A so they have confidence. Intel will have strong offerings in consumer and data center cpus.     Fab is new division and needs to sign on external customers. Their are good signs they are attracting outside interest for 18A and intels packaging business. Their pitch will be equal TSMC performance with discounts, and  alot of spare capacity. Intel only needs to sign a decent amount of customers to really help earnings.   Intel AI offerings are pretty small at moment. More of a 2025 story  If Intel gets 18A right. Expect product division to normalize earnings. And Fab to really improve margins. Stock is a single PE territory on normalized earnings IMO. My guess is a 3x over next 4 years  It was at $26, that's when reddit folks said it's over, that's when I bought. I'm confident in 3-5 years we are at $80-ish NVDA- Yearly Revenue: 60.92B Net Income: 29.76B Net Margin: 48.85% YoY EPS Growth: 288% PE Ratio: 73.21 PEG Ratio: 0.25 Total Equity: 42.98B ROE: 70.35% Market Cap: 2.21T INTC- Yearly Revenue: 54.23B Net Income: 1.69B Net Margin: 3.11% YoY EPS Growth: -42.9% PE Ratio: 113.74 PEG Ratio: -2 Total Equity: 109.97B ROE: 1.61% Market Cap: 187.51B Except for equity, Nvda has surpassed from top to bottom. Intel has potential, like others said the government won?셳 let them fail. But that doesn?셳 mean it?셪l be a good investment, just like Boeing. They hardly make money even with higher revenue than NVDA.  The reason I won't invest in Intel is bc their leadership sucks. Consistently make the wrong decisions, they let their best employees go, and they aren?Â�� keeping up with their competitors. The only reason Intel still exists is because they happen to be in a vital industry that is having a boom, apparently brain dead leadership can Even if Intel does okay over 5-10 years, I can get as good or better gains with a lot less potential problems. Is Intel undervalued? Absolutely, yes. Especially when you consider everything coming in the next year or two. The financials look messy right now because they're rebuilding and building out a Foundry. If you removed the Foundry buildout from the equation, Intel would be a single digit PE. But the Foundry buildout is a long term play that will add massive amounts of revenue going forward. Intel is about to have their hands in everything. It was a no brainer for me to load up on shares.  If you see the value in Intel and you expect them to grow in the next 10 years, it's a buy, if not, it doesn't . I bought a few shares and will add more as time goes on, but I'm usually staying away from hyped up stocks . Im a former intel engineer. They have a huge management problem. They hired lots of H1B prople as managers, these people only goal is to fire everyone that is not on H1B, so that they can get their own H1B friends in, even at the expense of the company itself. Lol do you how many engineers/managers in NVIDIA and other fortune 500 companies are on H1B? Intel sure has its own growth and talent retention issues but this is the stupidest take I've heard so far. Your point doesn't make sense. Nearly most of the FAANG is filled with H1B people. Look and compare AMD to INTC 7-8 years ago. Wish I bought AMD back then. You forgot to add China into your equation. China caused Berkshire Hathaway to sell their position in TSMC. If China starts to seriously threaten Taiwan, INTC stock will go ballistic, especially with their move to expand their foundry business. Also, IMO, INTC is totally undervalued. It's a bargain right now. Intel is trash. Going sideways for the last 7+ years. It feels like its going up fast Looks like sellers will be sold off Its a relief that only your stock is falling now Did they announce good guidance prospects Its a stormy night here What is going on Its messed up It went back up after hurting my stomach for 30 minutes
It went down again luckily lol Just like this All the way Dont you have to get a high point Nasdaq Its different from the national team if the performance comes out well it always skyrockets Buy in right after the performance report Pump and dump pump and dump Shinans song Reason for the drop after earnings announcement Expecting a 5 increase Semiconductor companies are not performing well in semiconductors Experiencing a gap down Sigh what a nuisance with disappointing results right Without us the management sold it off well probably adjust at the right time TSM / TSMC - Investing in TSM is investing in America Part 4 Sup fuck faces, WHAT DID I TELL YOU! Rolled my 155Cs/160Cs into the 165Cs/170Cs at 4/19 as again, they were ITM. Some of you are asking what my plan is - I will convert these calls to shares slowly but surely and hold TSM for life, but in the meantime, the rocket is loading. I've been getting a lot of requests about options and yoloing from you bozos who don't know how they work. This scares me. If you have to ask, please buy shares instead. Only gamble what you can afford to lose. And remember, with this much leverage, you are gambling, not investing. Thanks. Intel stands to win US$3.5 billion to produce chips for military (link) We are trying to domesticate chips. Subsidies for chip manufactures! Some critique is that we are subsidizing older chips and not exactly bleeding edge. ""If the CHIPs act was at least honest that they don?셳 care about leading edge, and say it is all about on-shoring essential chips and military hardware I would get it. But frequently they talk like getting the leading edge stuff is the main part of it. TLDR: WE WILL SEE WHICH COMPANIES ARE GETTING THE SUBSIDIES AT THE END OF MARCH. BET ON YOUR SEMI HORSES ACCORDINGLY. TSM Feb Revenue Report Feb revenues were up 9.4% YoY TLDR: 10% growth at this scale is fucking great. Dutch government tries to stop ASML from moving out (link) Again, everyone is subsidizing semis, the cream of the crop like ASML and TSM have a ton of leverage here. TLDR: When you got the best IP and processes, no one can tell you shit. Semi / AI Stonks If you look at how the Hot Semis are trading, here are the names I look at (they are all correlated) - INTC, TSM, ARM, AMD, ASML, NVDA, SMCI. This is because hedgies buy a basket of stocks that follow a theme to reduce volatility. However, it all starts with SPY. As you can see, when they all go up together, TSM goes up the most. When they go down together, TSM goes down the least. For those who want to learn, read up on the concept of Beta. TLDR: IMO, TSM is the chosen one for retail. TSM NEEDS THE US. THE US NEEDS TSM. But tbh I think all semis will do well. TSM + USA = AI SUPREMACY. NOW REPEAT AFTER ME. I HAVE auTSM AND WILL NEVER SELL MY TSM. I HAVE auTSM AND WILL NEVER SELL MY TSM.

Earnings are still not out yet and this stock has heavy $150 resistance. Trust the process. Still holding my 5/17 $170 and 5/17 $210 C What just happened with Nvidia reaffirmed my position to go more into TSM. Nvidia is almost 2% in the red while TSM only lost a fraction and is still 3% in the green. This proves that the stock is not nearly as dependent on Nvidia as people make it out to be. People forget that Apple is still TSMs biggest customer - everyone needs Semiconductors, not just Nvidia. TSM is also not nearly as overbought as Nvidia at this moment in time, so there is much more room to grow still.

This also lessen the learning curve of building an expansion fab of (12-16nm) at current site. US tied subsidies money to construction of most advanced node which means harder and slower construction and steeper learning curve for the local team. Japan fab is a joint-venture between TSMC 86.5%, Sony 6%, Denso 5.5% and Toyota 2%. These partners guarantee demand for its product, introduce TSMC to local supplier and help mitigate local union dispute. Japan decided on an amount (40%), approved and release subsidy all within the same year (2022). But US still haven't decided on a concrete amount let alone releasing the money, and even then the money isn't expected to be release until 2028. Japan's requirement for subsidy are 10 year commitment, increase output during shortages, and continued investment in the local factory. On the other hand, US subsidy requirement involve cross border expansion limit on China and Russia which increase the time and resource to review the details. Lower min wage in Kumamoto allows TSMC to offer wages 1/3 above market rate. Similar culture allow easier adaptation. Kumamoto also able to provide easy access to clean water. Cooperative local council that expedite permit and approval.  Close ties with local vendors in Japan and not active competitors (Intel, Samsung) in the same area was the biggest factor . Japan has some of the fastest turnaround times for building fabs in the world . Why did they need TSMC there in the first place? I know everyone was hit with shortages during covid but Japan has its own industry capable of making 22-28nm stuff. after Gap down in progress",2

2024-03-11,"Arent you a sergeant Why cant you go The leader goes up but the deputies dont Bidens passed significantly better legislation than Trump that lines up more with Trumps own ""Make American Great Again"" rhetoric. Legislatively speaking he's been a pretty successful president. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684 This is the most signicant investment in our nations infrastructure in decades. Some of things in this bill include Delivering clean water to more American families by eliminating the nation?셲 lead service lines.  Getting more Americans access to reliable high-speed internet. Repairing and rebuilding our roads and bridges Improving transportation options for millions of Americans and reducing greenhouse emissions through the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Upgrading our nation?셲 airports and ports to strengthen our supply chains. Making the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak.  Building a national network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers.  Delivering the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells.  CHIPS and Science Act https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4346 The CHIPS and Science  Act provides funds to support the domestic production of semiconductors and authorizes various programs and activities of the federal science agencies. It will Bolster U.S. leadership in semiconductors, it will secure domestic supply, create tens of thousands of good-paying, union construction jobs and thousands more high-skilled manufacturing jobs, and catalyze hundreds of billions more in private investment. The IRA is also very notable. https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text/rh The largest investment in clean energy and climate action, IRS funding giving them new AI tools to go after millionaires, 15 percent minimum tax on billionaire profits and by enacting a 1 percent excise tax on stock buybacks and redemption. The build America, buy America act](https://www.commerce.gov/oam/build-america-buy-america#:~:text=The%20domestic%20content%20procurement%20preference,produced%20in%20the%20United%20States), passed in 2021. Requires that all iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in covered infrastructure projects are produced in the United States. Comparitevely, when Republicans last had full government control under Trump the most significant legislation they passed was a 2Trillion dollar Tax Cut that cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.  ""Infrastracture Week"" became a running gag. I won't say Trump didn't do things I did not like, the First Step Act was a good first step, pun intended. And personally I liked the creation of Space Force despite everyone poking fun at it, and I stand by that still. Now you may say ""well what about the price of this?""  In 2020 the US had over 14% Unemployment, the biggest cut to oil production in US history, global supply chains crushed . The Fed under Trump as early as August 2020 warned Americans of impending high Inflation . We knew full well we'd have a rough few years of an economic recovery period . These can take a couple years to a decade to You may also say ""well we were energy independent under Trump."" We consume approx 20 Million barrels of crude oil a day. https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=33&t=6#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20United%20States,7.3%20billion%20barrels%20of%20petroleum. The most we produced under Trump was 13Million in November 2019. We hit 13.2 Million under Biden in November 2023 (When he started his term in January 2021 we were at 11.1 Million). Here is the official all time monthly oil production report from the EIA. https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MCRFPUS2&f=M You may say ""no new wars?"" Both Ukraine/Russia and Isreal/Palestine are ongoing conflicts. The latter is the worlds longest ongoing conflict since 1948. Even Trump had sent Lethal Aid to Ukraine, which he rightfully criticized Obama for not doing. Literally none of the things you listed have actually happened, Hes just written a check. Spending money without results are not accomplishments, let me know when all the lead is gone from our water infrastructure, I'm sure it'll be any day now. That's a weird criticism. It costs money to repair water pipes, pave roads, rebuild bridges, deploy high-speed internet, and build hundreds of thousands of electric vehicle charging stations. And it takes time to do those things too. You don't think presidents deserve any credit for doing things that time to accomplish? Of course, competent implementation matters too. But the first step is getting the legislation passed to authorize the projects. He should pass some legislation about the border instead of obviously allowing millions of undocumented people with no background enter into the country and making the cartels rich. It's weird that Biden has always been kind of a goof, and has undeniably gotten goofier, but he's been actually pretty effective at getting shit done Wow, all these Chinese bots being paid to write Biden compliments. Go to the grocery store and look at prices. Or travel to any major democrat led city. You will understand Biden, and his policies absolutely suck. The only people that live Biden. Or rich or far enough away from the crime and street levels to see his unraveling of American values Unfortunately the people you?셱e trying to reach will not listen and will either dismiss this entirely or haphazardly cite some extremely broad ?쐏roblem??that either can?셳 be something that?셲 solved in the short term or can?셳 be solved by Trump either I think you're being downvoted for being popular and factually correct. You?셱e right.  He is a good legislator.  But the open border stuff is wrong.  You want to migrate to America, then apply and get accepted otherwise you?셱e breaking the law and need to be deported.   This is simple, but lots of Democratic politicians don?셳 agree - although a huge majority of Americans do agree. Presidents can sign or veto legislation though, so they play an important role in the legislative process. And as leaders of their party, they can shape their party's legislative agenda. I think people sometimes overestimate the power that presidents have. For example, Biden can't waive a magic wand and enact legislation to codify Roe v. Wade. He had to deal with a handful of Democratic senators who wanted to keep the filibuster, and now he has a Republican House that would never protect abortion rights. Presidents can't just hypnotize legislators and control their votes.  When Biden came into office, he prioritized infrastructure and economic revitalization legislation . Biden's staff was meeting constantly with key legislators to try navigate the bill through Congress . Ultimately, a lot of Build Got Better got repackaged into the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act . Presidents are supposed to propose laws and sign bills into law. Obviously Congress is involved in this process too, but legislation is largely the responsibility of the President. Excited to Share: Accepted into ASU's Masters of Supply Chain Management Program! Hey Supply Chain Community, I'm absolutely thrilled to share some exciting news?봊've been accepted into Arizona State University's Masters of Supply Chain Management Program! My background might seem a bit diverse?봊 hold a BS in biology and spent three years working in warehousing for a major retail corporation. These days, I'm fully immersed in the world of semiconductor manufacturing, specifically in the quality and reliability department. Here's where it gets interesting: my company has generously offered to cover half of my tuition, leaving me responsible for the rest. As I make this transition into the supply chain side of semiconductor manufacturing, I'm eager to expand my skill set and qualifications. So, I'm turning to you, my for any insights or recommendations on certifications or skills that could further enhance my journey in this field. Thank you all for being part of this exciting moment in my professional development! Best, jpc273 Congratulations! Would highly recommend an APICS cert or Lean Six Sigma since you?셱e in manufacturing Congratulations from a fellow Sun Devil! As someone has said an APICS certification is a good start but it?셲 important to think about where you plan to be in the future as they have a lot of different options. Congrats!

Intel can?셳 even make their own chips this bodes well for TSMC Their CFO openly admits to relying on TSMC for their processors lol. I don?셳 know how anyone can be long on INTC right now. Join WSB Discord Which is why they?셱e investing in their own semiconductor production capabilities. Finished the post for you hoping TSM $200 by end of month *EOW So what ? Unlike both nvidia and AMD (who spun off their production), INTEL still possesses the capability of producing pretty advanced nodes and is further investing into its own production. Intel makes tons of their own chips they will be producing more in house as they build out more foundries. Man the wsb crew is extremely afraid of Intel doing well. There is constant misinformation or misleading shit about them here. Makes me think they are an excellent buy. I've bought into INTEL when they were down in the low 30s and buying more.  Intel will be the first to mass produce 20A (2nm) in 2024 . Samsung and TSMC will follow in 2025 . CEO Pat Gelsinger is going all in on retaking the technology lead . They got a contract with Microsoft  INTC has its own fabs that are aggressively running wafers to prove their next 5 processes over the next 4 years . All they are fabing out are the next tech nodes and ramping up yield . INTC is sacrificing short term gains and playing the long game . We all know that already ?쁻 Been holding some shares since 2010. OP really thinks INTC holders will be swayed by soft shit like that. Come back when INTC AI chips are killing folks, causing planes to fall, getting their chips put into production halt, getting investigated by regulators, and their whistle blowers dying in hotels before testimonies. BA is down only 4.66% btw. Intel makes a lot of money you nonce Also don't forget that Intel will be the largest beneficiary of government tendies from the CHIPS act. Intel net income for the twelve months ending December 31, 2023 was $1.689B, a 78.92% decline year-over-year. Intel annual net income for 2023 was $1.689B, a 78.92% decline from 2022. Intel annual net income for 2022 was $8.014B, a 59.66% decline from 2021. Intel annual net income for 2021 was $19.868B, a 4.93% decline from 2020. Sure but for how much longer? Oh wow, you discovered a well known fact for many years. That Intel is flexible in how and where it produces their chips depending on what gives them best risk/margin per product. Their factories are running close to capacity for the technologies they are speced for, and they outsource (have for many years) some production to TSMC because it gives them better margins overall. You have no clue how the industry works, which is fine, but don't get all excited you found publicly available information all by yourself. I got in at 26 so I'll ride along... Read this post and bought more INTC Buy Nvidia doesn't make their own chips either. It's an almost entirely white label operation in the United States.

What do you call short term? How about 4/19 ? AFAIK they are exclusively contracting TSMC for the GPU die.

2024-03-12,"Have you seen the blue sky My stock window INTC Gaudi accelerators beat NVIDIA A100 by 300% Calls on INTC? Join WSB Discord Up 15 cents!!!! ?쨷 Wow. Intel's new chips beating Nvidia's almost 4 year old chips? Nvidia is doomed. Gaudi2 comes in close 2nd place to H100. And Nvidia is launching new stuff, but Intel too. Intel?셲 really good in getting puff pieces into the media but falls flat when the product is used for real world workloads Remember - the customers are not the users, but the datacenters. And the datacenters metrics of cost have huge dependency on the flexibility of workloads chips can run/meeting their end-users' desires. Who would waste space in a DC on unproven chips with unrefined stacks and non-existent users? Don't get me wrong - almost anything is good news for INTC at this point - but I'd be weary in drawing parallels for potential success via NVDA. You'd be better off comparing with AMD. Depends on what NVDA announces next week + next earnings at NVDA. That said, if INTC starts mass producing the Gaudi 2 and it actually does benchmark as well as they say, it'll start to reflect on earnings. The catch is that NVDA still has the best software out there, so there's that to contend with. Overall good news for team blue. However, A100 will run both Stable Diffusion and LLM based models at scale. If you run a cloud service / datacenter with limited rack space you're probably still going with the A100. Come on guys just get the intel price up 300% so I can stay home and hang out with the family. Its dropping refreshingly Lets see how far it goes Just AMD Buy and hold Although it is the second in line due to NVIDIA CUDA but what breakthrough will it find As a beneficiary of AI stocks and a solid company no worries Micron (MU): Flushing money down the toilet? Micron Technology is a leading supplier of memory infrastructure that makes generative AI possible. AI stocks are very popular right now and Micron is positioned to be an essential supplier to the AI market. What specifically does Micron do to leverage the AI? Well, let me tell you. On February 26, Micron launched volume production of its HBM3E memory unit which provides lightning fast data access for Nvidia's H200 Tensor Core GPU. December earnings did not provide specific timing on HBM production, so this is a very promising release. Source Is this already priced in? Perhaps, but Micron is so essential to AI and with the first volume production going live, it is likely that MU will announce stellar guidance on their 3/20 earnings call. Volume increases may be ahead of schedule with production ramping up this early in 2024. Volume increases weren't originally forecasted until Q4.  Micron has been around for a long time but has not figured out how to make money . It is possible that continuing price challenges could offset gains from AI product sales . Micron expects prices to recover through 2024 . RSI for this stock is high at 64.32, however many technical indicators are suggesting this stock is a buy. Source Does anyone else want to lose money with me on MU? Positions: https://ibb.co/bBPYpFj Join WSB Discord I bought a large bag I mean amount of stock in anticipation of possible stellar guidance or such words being uttered at some point with another two letter acronym like AI being dropped in the mix. LFG ! Stock? You must have money to invest. Calls at 105 out in may let?셲 roll That's a long way out. Nice move. Memory market is low margins, and both Samsung and SK Hynix are serious competition for Micron. Memory market is in recovery and margins should improve throughout 2024 & 2025. Micron is a solid US-based memory maker, and AI is very memory intensive (HBM, DRAM, and NAND). Don't expect exponential gains though, and still plenty of risk in case margin's take a hit for unforeseen reasons. I have $60 Calls Jan 2026 Is Nvidia using Samsung or SK Hynix in its AI Gpu? The Nvidia AI products I'm looking at all have micron.  I've held a small amount of MU stock for years now (12 shares) and it's up 110% over the years . With the AI boom I've been watching them a bit more . If I make money from a few of my other bets in the next couple of days, I plan to buy more MU calls . All for Tendies and Tendies for all!

2024-03-14,"$NVDA. What changed? If you think this is the start of a big dip you're wrong.  NVIDIA is in business with all major US companies spanning from many different sectors of business activity . A short term correction is not an indicator of an unhealthy business, it is in my opinion a very healthy event from where it can drive organic growth into the upcoming years . Want to know if im right? Don't take my word for it, attend the GTC AI conference event: March 18-21 and hear for yourself. Join WSB Discord NVDA is higher than they ever were two weeks ago.

Make him a moderator He bought the top This is so stupid it may finally be time for puts. When you see posts like this, you know its over This is why you buy leaps, not weeklies. How are you all doing after the crash I live on the 27th floor in won  If Broadcom drops like this Based on past trends there is a very high chance of consolidation for a while caution advised It crashed without maintaining 194 If it drops further in afterhours trading I will respond with a repurchase Next generation of chips, NVDA vs AMD, looks bad for NVDA AMD's new chips will be a bit better irrespective of price, and will be twice as good per dollar. If I got something wrong in the table above, tell me so I can cover my short. I also made stats for INTC's new GPU, but it didn't look as good, so I left them off.  NVDA's high price/sales is justified by their huge margins -- 48% -- which they only have because competition has been non-existent . But that won't last, because they don't have a monopoly, TSMC has the monopoly . AMD over the decades, periodically sprung ahead in having the best offering in the CPU market over IN Also I hear NVDA engineers have gone soft now they are all rich. Join WSB Discord Nothing matters as long as every single framework for DL is running on top of very specifically handcrafted (and probably specially optimized in NVDA drivers) CUDA kernels. CUDA is what Windows is/was to Microsoft.. there was no (sane) alternative so everyone just hardcoded shit for it into everything and now we have to keep on using it because there is too much CUDA specific shit. Until legislators figure this out and slaps NVIDIA with some kind of antitrust they will just steamroll the competition, they can charge whatever they want there is no alternative People don?셳 understand that NVDA has everybody by the balls not because of their hardware, but because their CUDA framework is ubiquitous in ML/AI applications. AMD software have always been shit and until they can make ROCm better they will always be behind in market share. H200 isn?셳 the next gen, it?셲 current gen. B200 is next gen and we should see it announced this summer. If that?셲 not better than MI300X I think it?셲 fair to say Nvidia doesn?셳 look good. OP thinks the moat is hardware. Anyone can make faster hardware. Moat is software & services. Welcome to the Nvidia walled garden, everything is faster here and innovation. AMD is always catching up I?셫 all for bidding on AMD but I bid against Nvidia once and still regret it. I?셫 sure as hell not doing it again. Don?셳 recommend anyone else make that play. That is a good point. Google's TPUs, Facebook's MTIA, Amazon's Trainium, and Microsoft's Maia -- every single major buyer of NVIDIA's GPUs is also working on their own in house GPUs. Shareholders should sue the US government The expansion of AMD is being restricted by the US government

As I saw the stock pulling back a bit, I moved my stop loss up to 904.60. UNFORTUNATELY, the 903.97 stop was cancelled, and the 904.60 order was approved by Schwab's system, but then rejected by the Market Market. Apparently, the stock price moved down below my stop loss in the 0.20 seconds it took for Schwab to send the order to the Market Market. I immediately called Schwab to rectify, and they were no help and pretty much said ""nothing wrong happened on their end"" even though their system validated the order, cancelled the 903.97 order, yet no sell executions occurred. Be careful as Schwab is ABSOLUTELY NO HELP with regard to trade errors caused by their system. you shd trade in nyc at the stock exchange if you want zero latency. cmon. Sounds like you weren?셳 quick enough and are blaming them There are a lot of posts on here that fit a similar description. XD So you are bad at gambling? If you were planning to sell anyways, why do a stop loss and in such a small amount? Just sell 1000 shares at market at that time. Was it a trade error caused by their system though? SCHWAB is the greatest ...u messed up ...stop timing the market ..it never works. Was it a stop loss or a stop limit?

2024-03-18,"Bear case for MU on upcoming earnings using historical and statistical analysis. Other than optimistic market commentary MU has no reason to feel bullish about this upcoming earnings. I do believe they will pull through in the second half. PUTS. Key Financial Results: Revenue: Micron reported revenue of $4.8 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 12% from $5.45 billion in the same quarter last year, falling short of the consensus analysts??forecast of $5.1 billion. The decline reflects continued softening in global demand for DRAM and NAND products, exacerbated by intensifying competition and price erosion. Earnings Per Share (EPS): The company posted EPS of $0.65, underperforming against analysts??expectations of $0.75. This marks a 20% decline from the EPS of $0.81 reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The lower profitability is primarily attributed to increased production costs and inventory write-downs, impacting gross margins. Forward Guidance: Micron provided weaker than expected guidance for the upcoming quarter, projecting revenue in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion and EPS of $0.55 to $0.65, citing persistent market challenges and slower recovery in demand. Statistical Analysis: The earnings miss was underscored by a significant year-over-year (YoY) revenue decrease of 12%, illustrating the impact of adverse market dynamics on Micron?셲 core business segments. Additionally, the 19.75% shortfall in EPS against expectations reflects operational challenges, including higher than anticipated COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) and operational inefficiencies. The company?셲 forward-looking statements suggest continued caution, with projected Q3 revenue indicating a potential sequential decline of approximately 2% to 6%, highlighting ongoing demand volatility and competitive pressures in the semiconductor space. Management Commentary: Also likely: Earnings fail, rips to $78.43/share like the shit stock it is. Earnings call will consist of derp derp margin recovery herpty derp AI.

These things are usually contracted words used in a sort of a ""memory aid"" to help with the ritual instructions. On the first page ""T whm ds i rfr?"" is probably ""To whom does it refer?"" On the second page ""1st mtn - tk th rt hnd o th psn opst, i th odny mnr o shkg hnds."" is probably ""1st motion - take the right hand of the person opposite, in the ordinary manner of shaking hands."" I'm a Freemason and Past Master. This is a cipher for the Eastern Star initiation ritual. I can decode most of it, but some verbiage is different than the masonic rituals. How did you become a Freemason? Why did you want to join? To understand the cipher, you have to be a mason. It is gibberish unless you are told exactly what it says. It is practically a script of the ritual with annotated words to be a follow-along guide. Ok, that makes sense. Thanks! As others point out, this is actually for the Order of the Eastern Star, an auxilary organization open to Masons, but mostly for women with Masonic family connections. Here's a blurb I wrote about these texts. Its applicable here as well as to Masonic texts: [Mason here] This is a Masonic 'cipher book', a memory aid for lodge officers. Masonic ritual is delivered from memory. Officers who participate in ceremonies are required to memorize fairly long and complex lectures. Candidates going through the degrees are also required to memorize, and present, shorter passages. Traditionally, this material is supposed to be transmitted 'mouth to ear', directly from another member, without ever writing it down. There's a formal admonition to never do so. But we're human. People can't always get together to practice, and want to be able to work on their parts when alone. Also, mouth to ear has led to a centuries long game of 'telephone', with the speeches gradually diverging over time and space. So, people took notes. Eventually, a sub-rosa business grew up of printing the ceremonies, for purposes of practice, sold on the sly to officers. However, people didn't want something non-Masons could easily read, and they also wanted some plausible deniability in case someone accused them of having an Masonically illegal written text. To provide plausible deniablity to the holder, the early books don't mention Freemasonry at all; they assert that they are for followers of King Solomon, or an order of Essenes, or something like that.  To provide something you can rehearse from, but still (sort of) obey the rule to 'don't write it down', an encoding is used . Sometimes symbols replace letters or whole words, but often an abbreviation system is uesd . If I wrote: ""Ma ha a li la."" you'd have no idea what it meant. But if I also told you that the next line was ""Its fleece was white as snow."" the meaning of the first line would be instantly obvious. However, the abbreviated line on its own could mean anything. The parts that are actually secret are left blank. Those really are transmitted mouth to ear, but they are quite short. In the 20th century, Grand Lodges one by one conceded the reality of the situation, and now nearly all print their own 'official ciphers'. This made ceremony uniform across their jurisdiction, and froze in place the differences between jurisdictions.  If you really want to, you could probably find exposures of Masonic ritual . However (1) on the internet and off, they are mixed in with a mountain of inaccurate or made up material . You probably won't find one that matches the particular jurisdiction of the book at hand .

I love this community Lmao You?셱e up like 10% with insane downside risk lol good luck I don?셳 think betting against NVDA works very often and this week isn?셳 the best imo Hope you sold buddy That ain?셳 age well its not too late to delete this NVIDIA to announce nextgeneration products at GTC2024  With GPUs receiving the most attention in the AI field the world is watching Nvidias upcoming nextgeneration product announcement at GTC2024 from the 18th to the 20th
It is expected that the H200 will be released in the second quarter and the B100 twice the performance will be released at the end of this year
The market expects Nvidias stock to experience another significant UPGRADE when Nvidia announces its nextgeneration GPU at GTC GPU Technology Conference according to The Wall Street Journal Not rising even on days like this The eternal dilemma of the second place TLDR for those of you that didn?셳 watch NVDA livestream today NVDA is rebranding to SKYNET NVDA will convert the majority of the worlds workforce into GPUs within the next couple decades NVDA will definitively bring us into a Star Wars era of robotics within the next couple decades NVDA will have deep roots in every industry, including weather, biology, construction, warehousing, logistics, everything Databases will become intelligence generators.

2024-03-19,"Any hopes $INTC Join WSB Discord Hold onto them. Earnings is end of April, might run up a bit up to that point.. and also hope for some AI hype / Govt Grant / Partnerships, I believe Intel has great future in the chip space, and I am personally holding calls expiring May, and looking to buy some leaps also. Biden will announce chip act grand today in Arizona. Dude just arrived there. I was watching presidential schedule. It?셲 also part of his campaign tour. Hopefully he go full ape and give intel 1 trillion dollars to beat china. Intc is piece of shit, got exact same calls. But i bought them two weeks before you. So were both very very regarded, youre bit kore regarded tho. All in lovesac!!!! I have MAR 28 47 calls. Pray for me. 20 billion dollars!!!! That?셲 10% of the market cap. $60 eow for sure I sold my intc position for a profit. Waiting till next week to hop back in if the chart looks better Bro don?셳 listen to these chums im a believer or regarded either one. But you got a few more weeks and break even isn?셳 outrageously high. Keep holding nvda is squeezing out the calls this week but it?셲 gonna be on the move again soon and it?셪l bring up the whole industry with it. Hold bro H찼. No Why on earth would you go big on such a slow moving stock ? Intc doesn?셳 have breakout potential. Truly a regarded move You will lose everything INTC IS TAKING OFF Biden is using our money to take care of INTEL and the pre-market party has started. Let's gooo?쨿 Join WSB Discord It?셲 hilarious that something that has been known for MONTHS has an impact on the share price. Markets are mental. it's already priced in Yeah boiiii! Zoom in on the chart enough and you can make a 0.1% increase look like a rocket heading to the moon! Let's go regards. Is this a take off for ants? My march 28 46 call might print Idk why I keep buying into this shitty stock taking off where? it's month that's moving between 41.5$ and 46$ TAKING OFF XD Is it okay to go for a dip Why does it keep dropping when I buy it  Is this not good Its dropping because I bought it
Looking at the comments below it seems like I bought it wrong Me Ill bet it goes up today based on intuition  
I really trust my intuition Micron Earnings - Bullish Micron's (MU) earnings are today (3/20) after the bell, I'm feeling pretty bullish, here?셲 my reasons: First off, there's been an increase in analyst upgrades, suggesting some solid performance is anticipated. The growth in AI tech is a huge driver for increased demand in DRAM. AI applications need to process huge datasets at lightning speed, and that's pushing the demand for high-speed memory through the roof. Also, I?셶e been reading DRAM prices starting to climb. As supply tightens and demand from AI continues to expand, it's setting up a pretty favorable scenario for Micron?셲 pricing. Even though I'm bullish about Micron, I do have some concerns: They have heavy competition. There's likely somewhat of a slowdown in their consumer segments. This could be because people are cutting back on discretionary spending or possibly holding off on upgrading their PCs, possibly waiting for the new wave of ""AI PCs."" I'm concerned that any positive outcomes might already be reflected in Micron's current stock price, which could limit the upside from the earnings report. I could easily see it going either way. What do you all think? Anyone holding for earnings tomorrow? I?셶e got a mild 6 x 110c exp. 7/19 with an average cost of $4.53. UPDATE 3/21 (Day after earnings): Sold contracts today for $11.52 and made ~153% profit. Could likely run higher, but I?셝 rather take profit and avoid any type of drop in the price. Some sources for analyst upgrades: https://www.tipranks.com/news/micron-gets-a-new-street-high-price-target-ahead-of-earnings https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/03/37795929/micron-technology-poised-for-growth-on-strong-ai-demand-as-industry-enters-the-most-significant-memo Join WSB Discord Long-term bull, short term P/B is too high, DRAM is a commodity Hope you didn?셳 do this! Long term bull This post made me buy puts and I?셫 not enjoying it atm Oof?쪺orry about that. ?삱 Seems like more people are bullish, but, you never know: MU - Micron Technology Stock Put/Call Ratios - Barchart.com Aww shit here we go again digs up his 2018 MU 90C shitposts Ah yes, Micron. The original WSB play NVIDIA RTX 50 ?쏥B202??Gaming GPU reportedly features the same TSMC 4NP process as B100 It's going to be 2k and have 24g of ram though :( At some point there is going to be a market for modifying GPU cards to have more memory. You take that back If they slap a ""custom porn"" sticker on it these will be the fastest and best-selling graphics cards in the history of tech. only for the 16 gb vram version Just like physX cards back in the day, there should be consumer grade AI cards that supplement Gaming GPUs. Want better graphics in your game, upgrade GPU. Want faster/smarter AI in your game, upgrade AI card. It's a different time. Those solutions aren't really apropos. Remember CPUs were so bad at math that there used to be math co-processors. There was the 8087 to go with the 8086. In this case, what makes a good AI card is the same thing that makes a good GPU. So why would a good AI card cost less than a good GPU? By the same token, what makes a good PhysX card is what makes a GPU good. That's why there aren't PhysX cards anymore. 512 bit memory interface suggest 5090 might have 32GB of VRAM.  Let's say it will be 16x Samsung GDDR7 16Gb 32GT/s  like this  It would have bandwidth of around 2TB/s, so a touch more than twice that of rtx 4090/3090 Ti.  And it would have FP4 hardware maybe? Once It's in the base arch they may keep it. I think FP4 should helping with inference of quantized llm's. Maybe training in 4bits too, if you feel like training a small model from scratch.  What do you think are the chances Nvidia would go with 512 bus and 32GB of VRAM? And what would you do with it?  32 GB would give access to full speed for 30b parameter AI models and decent speed for 70b . It would give the Open Source community more power, and I don't believe Nvidia is completely opposed to it . Most obvious though is gaming, but its to keep up with bad optimizations. But the third thing is the combination: when future video games start running models in the background to generate things like dialogue, levels, etc. I would bet a reservation of 8 GB for the best models that have these applications. And it would have FP4 hardware maybe? Unfortunately that's an easy way to segregate consumer and datacenter cards without too overtly harming gaming perf...so money money is on nope My body yearns for an affordable RTX 5060 with 16 GB RAM Ugh did I make a mistake buying 2x4090s recently Do you seriously think you'll get your hands on a 5090 anytime soon?? This is big news. I think we were all expecting GB202 to use TSMC 3N. TSMC's ""4nm"" nodes right now are serving a huge volume of chips. Except for Apple, all the other whales (Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, Mediatek) are using it. Who is this ""we""? 4N entered production 2 years after N5. We have zero evidence N3E is actually in production right now. Even N3B is in production for less than 9 months. Nobody should expect Nvidia or AMD to ship N3-based products with any meaningful quantity in 2024. Which means price wont increase as much, if at all, as they are the same 5nm process. Might even decrease. Considering 5nm age There should be a 30% transistor density increase and new SM structure There should be a 30% transistor density increase I wouldn't bet on that. Ada is already significantly denser than Hopper; Blackwell is pretty much in line with Ada with both around 125 MT/mm2. Yeah, and some charts show a price decrease by 2025ish? So I hope a 700mm2-ish GB202 will have similar BOM to AD102 by then (5090 Ti for $1999 if 70% or more raster over the 4090 and 2.5x or even more PT would be sweet). ?쏮ight even decrease??$TSMC  AMD based on leaks essentially surrendered their top card in RDNA4 and the 8800XT is seemingly going to be either a 7900GRE or 7800XT that?셲 cheaper . Nvidia might loose some market share but they are still raking in margins . Hoping there's a reasonable efficiency gain and not just straight up higher power numbers if this is true. Nvidia always improves the power efficiency. This last one also had a big efficiency gain, just compare cards at the same power usage and you will still see a huge gain in performance  I suspect with 128MB L2 Cache & 512-bit bus taking huge amounts of the die was not worth it cost wise . By the end of 2024 some N4 variant at TSMC could be hyper optimised to be almost on par with N3E in power consumption .  A full die that's 70% or more in raster over the 4040 with humongous Ray & Path Tracing improvements (like Xpea & RGT are hinting/talking about) with 'reasonable' power consumtpion (say a 192 SM 5090 Ti is just over 500W) on N4P/X Overall this generation if as rumoured really has some parallels to Maxwell which where often larger dies but big performance per watt increases over the previous architecture despite being on the same node. This makes sense. The architecture will probably give an okay performance bump on its own, and being not on the cutting edge node means not bidding against the likes of Apple for wafers and saving a ton of money. This money will probably not translate into affordable or compelling gpus in the slightest, but it?셲 not like Nvidia has to actually make good gaming products anymore. Yep, it only means greater profit margin for Nvidia and for gamers another generation with stagnant/worse price to performance ratio.  So it seems it will not be 3nm as originally suspected by people, instead it will use an enhanced TSMC 5nm node . This is very similar to TSMC 12nm (Turing) vs TSMC 16nm (Pascal), just density improvements .  We could see costs for GPUs come down this generation, as they're using an older node now, rather than the cutting edge 3nm node . This has two benefits for gamers possibly . But then again, Turing was expensive and on an ""old node"" then too .  NVIDIA could prioritise datacenter and professional GPUs to capitalise on AI craze . They won't be sharing capacity with AMD (once AMD stops production of Zen4 ofc), Apple, Intel, Qualcomm etc, so we might also have costs come down . Either way, very interesting to see how Blackwell ends up performance wise considering it looks like we are in for another generation of 5nm (maybe 4nm) dies.  It makes sense from a business stand point to move off of the latest and greatest node for gamers . Why would they waste top tier silicon in one segment where they could make 10x or more by using it for datacenter/ai products? No, unfortunately it won't be cheaper for us. Biggest performance boost will come from just having a bigger die, what will ""pay"" for that bigger die is that more mature process. It?셲 way more complicated than this My understanding is that Blackwell uses a higher density library, which explains the need for its improved packaging so it won?셳 heat up too much. Just because you have a ??nm class??or ??nm class??doesn?셳 necessarily dictate performance. TSMC charges for library makeup as well as overall class of node. You want higher density? You suffer more yield issues even at the same ?쐍ode class?? You then pay more per usable wafer. Of course, what?셲 more likely is that TSMC has simply become better at providing higher yields on the high density library. And is simply passing on those benefits to Nvidia at a similar price. The strength of staying within the same node class is that the design family is consistent and therefore lessons learned can be applied consistently. Bracing for impact that the 5090 will cost at least $2000 If it?셲 like 100% performance uplift? Fucking send it (I am once again delusional) I don't even get excited for their cards anymore. My 4070ti was like $900, so I can only assume the next line up will be just as if not more expensive. All I want is more VRAM.  All I want is the 5080/5080 Ti to be back on the big die like the 3000 series . The $700 3080 was objectively a great value at -5-15% performance vs the 3090 . Adjusting for inflation, if we got a $850-900 5080 that is ~15% off the 5090 You get more performance per dollar with a 4080S at $1000 than a 4090 at $1600. The 4090 is 60% more expensive for 25-30% performance gains. I would also like the 80 series to be within 5-15% performance, but Nvidia has no incentive to cannibalize the 90 series market, which is higher margin. Not necessarily good news. 40 series cards are very power efficient due to the huge fab leap from Samsung 8nm to TSMC 4nm. If 50 series largely stays in the same fab node, its power efficiency might be as bad as 30 series. Not necessarily good news. 40 series cards are very power efficient due to the huge fab leap from Samsung 8nm to TSMC 4nm. If 50 series largely stays in the same fab node, its power efficiency might be as bad as 30 series.  TSMC N4P (not to be confused with what NVIDIA calls 4NP) is an enhanced 5nm node from TSMC . It reduces power by 22%, has a 6% density improvement and increases clock speeds by 11% . 4N from NVIDIA's Lovelace was a 5nm TSMC variant, which we only assume to be very close to TSMC N5HPC probably with some NVIDIA customisations. 4NP might be close to TSMC N4X with customisations, it might be N4P or it might be entirely something new that's not close to any TSMC 4N node yet. Could be more performant, or less. Agree. I don?셳 see this gen getting as big of an uplift compared to 3090 to 4090. does that mean the power consumption will be crazy on these cards? Not always they managed to bring power draw down with maxwell even on the same 28nm node as Kepler and they were hoping that they could get a node shrink that never happened back then too. They are also going to 4NP and not 4N so its a slight node bump too. hopefully the price will not move higher than what we already see for the 40series we'll only know that once it is about to release The 5090 will be unavailable for years. If you thought getting a 4090 was hard at launch due to crypto this time around you have crypto + ai + actual countries like el salvador buying I?셪l keep my 3090 lol All the cutting edge fab nodes are being gobbled up by AI demand. We should get used to this. Future AI demand will probably be worse than the crypto boom on GPU scarcity for gamers. New fabs are planned but will take years to build - and not many of them will be able to build the smallest nodes, <5nm. Oh the post isnt coming up here Seems like no interest lol Salvaging INTC Call position? I have the following INTC call option losing money (down $960 as of post): INTC 19 Apr, 47 strike call 5 contracts. Placed 3/7/2024 What?셲 a straightforward and cost-effective way to reduce my loss? And for how long do I have to hold that new combined position before I sell? Thanks in advance for constructive feedback. Edit: To everyone criticizing me about the position and INTC in general, thank you, but it's not helpful. Read my question. I am trying to find tactics to lessen my loss. Edit #2: I sold the position for a $989 loss. Lesson learnt. Thanks to everyone who gave constructive feedback. Life goes on. Straightforward way to reduce loss = close out your position Same bag here. Thought the news article about the better then Nvidia Chips would make it soar but its going down instead. I'm holding mine but it's an acceptable loss. The expected move for 19 April is $4.30, which isn't even enough to get you to break even, and most likely that move will predominantly be down, not up. You might mitigate the loss with a straddle or strangle, but that's going to be expensive and you risk increasing your loss by doing that. Since this is a straight call, theta is not on your side. Your losses are going to mount daily even if the price remains flat, so your best loss reduction strategy is to bail out now. I don't think there's another strategy available that reduces your losses without increasing your risk substantially. Tip: Open the trade with 1-2 contracts, not 5. Then add more contracts as the price moves in your favor. In this case, you wouldn't have added a single contract since the stock tanked the day after you bought it. You'd be down $192 or $384 right now if you'd done that, not $960. Lol I sold those to you ;) lol. Touch챕. I wheel INTC so love that it?셲 trading in this range. Lots of premium to collect!  I don't see Intel getting to $47 + by your expiration date . Sell soon to get some of your money back . Buy shares and sell covered calls against them? That will get you back some of the money . Lesson your loss. Close out for a loss before it gets bigger, or take risker strategy to break even with the possibility of losing more money, or hold till expiration and risk getting wiped out. Those are the risks, I don?셳 know what other answer you are looking for but 90% traders lose money Did you look at the volume to open interest. That contract is full of resistance and going nowhere fast. The whole contract is nothing but resistance. What were you looking at? I don't buy options as losing happens far too often for me, but a tactic I would consider is selling a 47.5 call to turn this into a vertical spread. You don't post what you paid so this is a shot in the dark but selling that call will bring in something like .42 or $42 per contract, around $210 to soften the loss by some amount. This should still have some a profit if the stock rises, but with a .15 delta the probabilities are not good that will happen.  Constructive feedback is to develop and follow a detailed trading plan that spells out when to close for what profit or loss percentages or amounts . This will prevent trades from getting away from you for such large losses . Why did you pick that strike. Even if the price of the stock had stayed the same you would be losing. Do you use a hockey stick diagram to see how things might play out. If the price was 47.65 today you might be at a break even. https://app.screencast.com/uMizGAF0jd1Hh I?셫 holding Jan 25 calls at 50 and 55, sitting tight for now but it?셲 painful to see the paper losses I'm actually in the same boat but I'm bullish so I've been buying more calls on the way down. Capping my gamble on this to 3k loss and I'll sell and move on. I'm bullish so I've been buying more calls on the way down You'd feel right at home in the meme stock subs.  If you have lost more than 50% then it might be too late to save what? The best course of action is to sell to close . Do you want to hedge for a short-term down side move for this week and then remove the hedge? Something like that. INTC is a dog, and I don't see any thing that would push the price above 47 within the next month. Limit your less and find another stock to bet on. Or hold if you can afford the loss, hopping that the price gaps up above your strike. My question is HOW do I limit the loss?! When it goes up do half on Nvidia When it falls NVIDIA rises

2024-03-20,"AMD FSR 3.1 Announced at GDC 2024 Framegen and upscaling are now decoupled (pretty huge for those who want to use DLSS upscaling with FSR3FG on older RTX GPUs) Improvements to FSR upscaling quality; less flickering and/or shimmering, less ??꼒zziness??around objects in motion, ghosting reduction, and better preservation of detail First game to get it will be Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart later this year Improvements to FSR upscaling quality; less flickering and/or shimmering, less ??꼒zziness??around objects in motion, ghosting reduction, and better preservation of detail Jesus Christ fucking finally. FSR upscaling hasn't gotten a quality upgrade since FSR 2.2 back in December 2022. In that time span the upscaling portion of DLSS got like 3 major upgrades, hell even XeSS got 2 upgrades during that gap. The shimmering improvements look substantial, though there's some remaining. Will have to see if that's viewable at TV distance. Right now it's pretty easy to tell when something uses FSR in motion. I can???wait until FSR3 gets modded into Vulkan games Allows FSR 3.1 frame generation technology to work with other upscaling solutions. Fantastic! FINALLY VULKAN SUPOPRT Hopefully, with them now splitting their frame generation from upscaling, it can easily be implemented in things like gamescope. Old v New  XeSS DP4a/FSR-AI may also be larger than people expect . It's still good to be improving this non-ML model BTW. Nobody is hurt by having options: plenty of hardware will never have access to AI/ML upscalers at all .  Some power-amplifiers can output huge, powerful signals, others are precision amplifiers that deal with small signals at the mW level and can't scale to hundreds of watts . Not all amplifiers are equally good, but obviously not all are equal good .  DLSS gives XeSS-like quality without the computational expense . FSR has a very low computational expense, but higher noise-factor . DP4a is in-between - more computational expense but also better quality .  The gifs look good/improved . I don't think there's the gas in the tank to catch up to the AI models in the long-term . The FSR2/3 non-AI pathway will be what a lot of people have to live with . Thank you AMD for decoupling FG from FSR. Your frame generation is actually decent and people want to use it, but not at the cost of using FSR. Letting people use it with DLSS, XeSS, or no upscaling at all is great and it should have been that way from the start.  AMD's own software reports like 40% micro stutter . Only way I was able to fix it on my 6600xt was to reduce refresh rate to 100hz . Same experience Digital Foundry has had . You can do that too, it's just terrible naming like DLSS3. I think this means the new FSR upscaling version will be 3.1 rather than 2.2, assuming devs implement the latest version. It should be possible now. They have made it separate. Developers just need to implement it properly  Still waiting for Intel to open-source XeSS like they promised Once they do, it'll be interesting to see if the projects merge.  TSR for example looks better than 2.2 in motion, but also costs you FPS . The point of FSR, DLSS, XeSS, etc, is to increase frame rate . I'll be curious to see if there is a performance hit to this as well .  I'm skeptical this is a ""free lunch"", as they say . With Nvidia aggressively scaling tensor cores performance, I'd be shocked if they haven't made DLSS more costly over the years . I'm curious to see some older games with the new DLSS versions . DLSS has gotten faster (i.e. reduced cost) overtime and improved quality in case you are wondering. Here is the total cost on mulitple cards from the dlss 3.5.1 programing guide https://imgur.com/a/NkNnO32 A 2080 TI at 4k is 1.26 MS A 3090 is 0.79 MS A 4090 is .51 MS. This is from 3.5.1 - https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS/blob/main/doc/DLSS_Programming_Guide_Release.pdf For reference here in the old dlss 2.3.0 Here the 2080 Ti 4k costed 1.43 MS The 3090 was 0.99 ms https://imgur.com/a/6ApMedX https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS/blob/60a82446c330cdd3339ea602a6ef0f928288a021/doc/DLSS%20Programming%20Guide%20Release.pdf On average i would say it cost ~20% less comparing 3.5.1 vs 2.3.0 A very good example of speedup is that the 3080 with 3.5.1 (0.93 ms) is faster than 3090 with 2.3.0 (0.99ms) The point of FSR, DLSS, XeSS, etc, if of course to increase frame rate. DLSS is also the best AA solution on the market by a long shot. Are they really using a 298x179px gif to show off the improvements to their upscaler? That's either utter incompetence or they're hiding something, but knowing AMD it could be both. Edit: that said, it's pretty nice of them to allow us to use FSR framegen with other upscalers, since their framegen does have decent image quality, but I wouldn't be surprised if nVidia ""discouraged"" developers from implementing that. These GIF examples were taken from video captures of Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart running at 1080p using AMD FSR 2.2/3.1 Performance mode. I think the whole point was focusing on the improvements to its worse case. A higher input resolution would actually favor against ghosting and stability. Maybe the issue is doing a rushed gif snippet lol I hope that the top Rift Apart picture isn't representative. It may be more temporally stable and have better antialiasing, but the overall image clarity is so much worse.

I'm still on 23.12.1 because of that. Thanks. I'm glad they fixed at least some of the AFMF stutters. There were serious regressions in 24.2.1 compared to their initial release in 24.1.1.

Noah Travis wrote a blogpost a few months ago about how it would be a good idea for Japan to focus on semiconductor manufacturing https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/six-reasons-chipmakers-should-put  The first four reasons are a weak yen, a preexisting supply chain, a highly skilled workforce, and the fact taht Japan has a much easier time getting things built than the west these days . Another two reasons had to do with a desire for the government and corporations to catch up and become cutting edge again . Noah Smith admitted in It's also no secret that Japan has a toxic corporate culture. People often get promoted for being at the company for longer rather than for doing a good job. These companies are also oftentimes slow to change. In this article, he focused on this issue. Three solutions he came up with are to encourage mid career hiring, allow hybrid remote work, and to let companeis fail https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/fixing-japans-broken-corporate-culture  Japan has been stuck with this problem since the 1990s because the national bank of Japan has had low interest rates . Until the recent decision to raise the rate to 0.1, it was actually negative, meaning that borrowers would not have to do anything with the loan, pocketing the negative interest .  Interest rates will continue to go up, holding weak companies up to the fire . This will force them to start making a profit or go out of business . Startups may emerge to fill the void once the pruning process is finished . These startups may adopt a more meritocratic approach to hiring and promoting . So far, Japan has lagged behind the US in economic growth and even behind Europe with Germany now having a larger GDP than Japan. It remains yet to be seen as to whether Japan gets back on its feet or if it will continue to stagnate but Japan does have genuine advantages over the US like being able to build stuff. I thought his last name was Smith I thought his last name was Pinion. It is! I wonder if it's an inside joke. Japan is having good growth again Not necessarily just from semirconductors Probably because the neighbourhood has gotten better South-east Asia's rise is helping Japan's high value added economy grow People don't recognise that many times, growth is not in the hands of politics, but chance Japanese export to Southeast Asia as a percent of total exports: 17% Japanese import to Southeast Asia as a percent of total imports: 15% Na I think you just making shit up. Noah Travis should not be your source, or at least not your only source. His name is Noah Pionion  Sears was a good store that sold high quality products are reasonable prices and treated their employees right . Eddie Lampart bought Sears and tried to bilk it for all it was worth and drove it into the ground . He should be locked up for what he did . I have an original 1950s shirtwaist dress from Sears. It's practical and clearly for a certain kind of budget but it's so incredibly well made, you can't imagine a similar store nowadays selling something like that.  member the plaza accords? I member Market up but INTC (Intel) is down after getting 8.5B from government? I know this is overly simplistic (I?셫 a noob), but I have also seen this with SPCE?쫆 successful flight and stock goes down. Today, all my positions are up 2-4% except INTC which is down slightly. How does it make sense that good news has a negative effect? I realize there?셲 a lot more to consider than a government handout but today?셲 performance of INTC has me scratching my head. Is the market manipulated that badly? I know very little so please go easy on me.  Intel is basically a national security asset of the US government at this point . Having all chips manufactured in China and Taiwan will end terribly if things go south with China . Intel will become a large player again but it will take time . All priced in already as it was basically assumed prior to announcement Not sure about that, when there was that news piece about not getting funding secured a few days ago or so, it dropped a bit, but now that everything is ok, still hasn?셳 got up to its prior value that day. typical stonkz Intel is losing ground to the competition every day, and there could be a lot of shorts on it driving price down or keeping it down. TSMC hires the brightest in Taiwan, Samsung hires the brightest in Korea. Intel does not hire the best engineers in America. When new grads get out from college, it is the mag7 first. Intel might spike in short term, but long term wise they have alot to fix. They remind me of Boeing in terms of complacency and overpromise. Gonna make this as simple as possible:  News like this makes absolutely zero impact on a stock over the span of a few days or longer . Same is true when a stock is nearing a sentiment cycle bottom . Negative catalysts can result in a reversal to the upside, even if it takes a quick spike down first . That?셲 it. That?셲 how this works. Giving them money was already expected. This surprised no one  No one in this sector takes intel seriously. Throwing more money at them doesn't change the absolute fact that the company has the worst talent pool in the sector and worst product offerings. They have failed at designing and fabricating industry leading chips in the past, and they will still continue to fail in the future .  People/institutions with a lot of money do not want to pick stocks that are objectively inferior to the competition . They are an inferior company at the end of the day . When those big money players have a reason to buy intel, then you?셪l see it rise in stock price . Just curious, why do you think the 8.5B from the government is going to do anything? Intel had so much cash from 40 years of complete dominance from 1980-2020. Why didn't they reinvest their extra cash into themselves, and what will another measly 8.5B do? Oh they were happy to invest the money in themselves. Source: https://ycharts.com/companies/INTC/stock_buyback  I was confused about how this announcement would cause the price to be suppressed more than what I was seeing with the rest of the market today . I would have expected it to at least be in line, not down . I don't know enough about shorting so I should probably do more homework before posting . NVDA, META & SMCI: clouds clearing up? Looks like all clouds hanging over NVDA (GTC), META (TikTok) and SMCI (2m shares sale at $875) are clearing up and these pups are ready to fetch some money for us. I think, NVDA has no competitors and is basically competing against itself?ㄳ As we all know, supply chain constraints have eased up so NVDA will be able to ship more to its customers, Apple entering AI and partnership with NVDA will only add to NVDA earnings. NVDA?셲 ability to ship more chips will also boost SMCI. And after its 2m shares sale, SMCI has lot more money to buy NVDA chips and build more servers. I loaded my 3 trucks with NVDA, SMCI and META! I think, all these companies will again blow up earnings :-) Time coming to make more money?뮥. Don?셳 take this as advice, do your own research DD and never NEVER take more risk than you can afford! Decent call on Smci and Nvda to add but I think Meta is near their year out top . The year out top doesn?셳 mean the stock won?셳 run, but I think ultimately it retreats to this area in a year. IMO, META has two big events helping it for next few weeks and may be into earnings: Schumer can play his delay tactics as much as he wants but eventually Uncle Sam will ban TikTok DOJ & 16 states just filed antitrust against AAPL. Both of these events will help META. Also, META?셲 partnership with NVDA will continue to help it big time as it did in Q1. At market open, I bought 5000 AAPL puts with strike $170 at $0.15 expiring 3/22, it?셲 already about $0.60??. Already have tons of META calls and rebalanced NVDA and SMCI. NVDA?셲 ability to ship more chips will also boost SMCI. There's this bit about how, with NIM and other additions, Nvidia wants to also get into the business of building data centers, not just provide the GPUs. So there's competition for SMCI and others. Nvidia is going to crush all current and future competition. 100% agree! NVDA does have competitors. However it does have roughly 80% of the market share. If NVDA doesn't break through 1000 it will be in a trading range from 850 to 950 until earnings and may see another push in May and a push in IV if you are trading options. It is possible that companies reporting before NVDA could prove to be a catalyst if there is mention of BW purchases or other chip makers showing more revenue in the space. I think will se a stock split nearing the 1,000 mark probably will be filled sometime in the summer June/July if it keeps ramping up Nvda doesn?셳 have a competitor at the moment. Chip makers are not competitors. Nvda?셲 software and platform is what set?셲 it apart and there simply isn?셳 anyone else that can compete. Im all in, ira included. NVDA stock is so wild. Pre marked was at 922 so I sold everything when the markt got open. I bought in at 907 again. This joke made me almost a extra 1000 dollars. Crazy world...... I wonder when the time comes I aint so lucky anymore. I?셫 with you. I think NVDA is safe, but I?셫 still going to have as few stocks as I can around the election (so selling before November) add ARM to the list One-Minute Daily AI News 3/20/2024 French regulator fines Google ??50m for unlicenced use of online news sites to train its AI bots.[1] Medics design AI tool to predict side-effects in breast cancer patients.[2] Chipmaker Micron?셲 shares surge as AI boom drives strong forecast.[3] Amazon gets boost from 72% pop in AI company Astera Labs??IPO.[4] Google?셲 AI can predict floods up to 7 days in advance.[5] Sources: [1] https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/french-regulator-fines-google-250m-for-unlicenced-use-of-online-news-sites-to-train-its-ai-bots/a3771637.html [2] https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/mar/20/medics-design-ai-tool-to-predict-side-effects-in-breast-cancer-patients [3] https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-forecasts-third-quarter-revenue-201239090.html [4] https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/amazon-gets-boost-from-72percent-pop-in-ai-company-astera-labs-ipo.html [5] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-ai-can-predict-floods-up-to-7-days-in-advance-heres-how-it-works/articleshow/108664319.cms (tips watering can over plant) - I told ya it was gonna rain!

Protectionism is good  Free trade allows multinational corporations to export labor overseas, destroying domestic industries and increasing the exploitation of workers both at home and abroad . At home, because when these industries are gone the demand for domestic labor decreases and workers lose bargaining power . Abroad, because these corporations directly take advantage of horrible working conditions in countries where sweatshop workers are treated almost literally  A huge portion of computer chip manufacturing for the whole world occurs in Taiwan . China can use that leverage to great effect if they take over . Free trade is bad for national security because it makes a country excessively dependent on things outside its control .  A country which offloads and neglects certain industries will not develop expertise in those fields . Free trade discourages expertise, innovation, and education . Take the example of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. because we have offshored this industry, we don't have nearly as many experts .  International trade is vital to the modern world, but it should be regulated and conducted with an eye not towards the shallow, short-term gain of getting cheap goods now, but to the long-term goal of developing healthy economies . Protectionism will be a vital tool in ensuring this happens .  Since post WW2 and the increase of interdependency of the trade you describe world violence from war has decreased . After all, you yourself are describing why nations don?Â�� go to war . That is why would the USA, China, etc want to destabilize their economic stability that is so dependent on trade?  Capitalism has no obligation to solve all of society's problems, and dumping all of our low-cost manufacturing elsewhere has allowed us to invest in higher skill, higher value industries . Making semiconductors isn't as valuable as knowing how to design them, for example . Making cars isn?ÂÂÂ³ as important as software or AI development You also misunderstand the Taiwan situation. The world?셲 reliance on Taiwanese semiconductors is what guarantees Taiwanese security and makes China hesitant to invade them as we speak, as invasion will damage much of that infrastructure and make it likely the West will intervene to protect their semiconductors. It?셲 an example of how specialization and interdependence have guaranteed stability and peace in the Eastern Pacific. Sweatshops may be inhumane, but what if the alternative to exploitation is not to be exploited? Is it better to work 12 hours a day for a dollar an hour, or have no work at all?  Neoliberalism still works, and no alternatives proposed have proven feasible to sustain . The current world order only destabilizes when actors detract from liberal values, as liberal values tend to be mutually reinforcing . Protectionism and the desire for ???ational security??have only led to prophecies of upcoming war . This is by far one of the weirdest takes I've seen. Wow, I don't think I've seen a post here that I disagree with more than this. Free trade is bad for national security because it makes a country excessively dependent on things outside its control. Peace requires vulnerability and lack of control. Why do you think MAD has worked so well? If the US and China both felt completely in control, war would be much much more likely to break out. Why is everyone so worried about Taiwan right now? A huge portion of computer chip manufacturing for the whole world occurs there. China can use that leverage to great effect if they take over. If the U.S. or other countries had a robust semiconductor industry, they wouldn't have to face this threat. Taiwan's semiconductor industry would not survive an invasion. And to my earlier point, this interweaving of interests and industries keeps peace in that region. If it were not for semiconductors, Taiwan would have gotten invaded years ago. Free trade discourages expertise, innovation, and education Couldn't be more wrong. Free trade increases talent density, increases competition and forces greater innovation for success. Why does the US lead in R&D as opposed to closed nations like North Korea? A country which offloads and neglects certain industries will not develop expertise in those fields, nor will it be capable of innovating in them. Take the example of semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Because we have offshored this industry, we don't have nearly as many experts in the field and aren't at the forefront of developing new manufacturing processes The semiconductor industry is too complex for any nation to undertake effectively. The counterargument to what you just said is that if the US never involved other nations in the industry, it would have never advanced to its current stage, which would have allowed China to beat the US. As it stands now, semiconductors are too complex for China to solve on its own. Furthermore, the US is still the linchpin in semiconductors. They have massive sway over ASML, TSMC, and lets not forget that the dominant architectures are US led. Damn near the whole industry is dominated by the US in some way. This would not have happened if the industry was locked up in the US. A country which offloads and neglects certain industries will not develop expertise in those fields, nor will it be capable of innovating in them. Ok and? We need billions of people to maintain the current level of specialisation and productivity. Without that everyone is worse off. There is a reason you don't live in a cabin in the woods doing subsistence farming. I was going to do a serious reply but I'm tired and bored so lets give it Jensen:  You are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples. There are no nations, there are no peoples! There are . no Russians or Arabs! There . are no third worlds! There is no West . There is only one holistic system of systems, one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multi-vari The purpose of international trade in the development of nations is to 1. Provide countries with the raw materials for the means of production as a temporary measure to develop self-sufficiency, 2. Provide countries with the means of production themselves, and 3. Provide countries with a means of liquidity so as to perpetuate 1 and 2. If trade impedes any of those three in the long term, then it?셲 bad. oh definitely, it allows domestic producers to compete fairly on the world stage and enables industrial development Your grasp of even basic economics is so flawed, it is difficult to know where to start in rebutting your positions. I will just say that since the time of Adam Smith, free trade as been extolled by economist. In fact, only a fringe economist would agree with your position on free trade. Competition--international competition--is what allows the best products to bubble to the top. Protecting industries from competition inevitably leads to an uncompetitive industry and higher costs with inferior products for the people of the protectionist country. You also mention exporting jobs allows exploitation of foreign workers, who often work under horrific conditions. Again, your viewpoint is flawed in many respects. You should consider what those foreign workers would do but for those exported jobs? They would simply starve. I highly recommend that you learn some basic economics. We block country A from importing their cheap clothing, they block US pork ranchers from exporting pork, and we then retaliate more. Soon its a nasty world wide trade war which will cause a massive worldwide depression and poverty, starvation. You socialists always get stuff wrong and never think about unintended consequences. I don?셳 think we should be looking at whether protectionism is ?쁤ood??or ?쁞ad?? Economists prefer a concept called comparative institutional analysis, which is an analysis studying economic organization from a consequential perspective in a case by case basis. Rather than trying to group something as necessary always good or always bad. But ultimately, your analysis is a fundamental misunderstanding of what free trade is. Free trade allows multinational corporations to export labor overseas, destroying domestic industries and increasing the exploitation of workers both at home and abroad. Free trade refers to the barriers of trade (think subsidies, tariffs, etc.). Free trade does not mean the absence of regulation. What you?셱e describing is a lack of domestic labor regulation. Free trade is bad for national security because it makes a country excessively dependent on things outside its control. Sure, this is the cost of taking advantage of comparative advantage. Free trade discourages expertise, innovation, and education.  The basis of comparative advantage is that a country specializes in producing things it?셲 good and efficient at, and import things it.?셳 have its place in international trade . This way, both countries become much richer than if they were to produce all industry domestically . I?셝 recommend reading the r/askeconomics FAQ on free trade, it can help clear up some misconceptions you may have. Everything you said is wrong. But I want to focus on one thing because it's the most annoying to hear over and over: ""Abroad, because these corporations directly take advantage of horrible working conditions in countries where sweatshop workers are treated almost literally like slaves."" This is literally the opposite. The people in those countries are in WORSE condition before free trade. The sweatshops are bad by our standards, but they are MUCH better than what they had before. You are lying/deluded and want to make life worse for these people. You pissed of socialists and capitalists with this. Free trade is bad for national security because it makes a country excessively dependent on things outside its control.  If production stops, new sellers are incentivized to enter the market to take their place . Free trade is the solution to this, but in free trade you have many buyers and sellers . This is a double standard. When you abolish free trade, you force everyone to become excessively dependent on the state . Nixon said it best. A world-class country has to have world-class goods and services. 1+1 = 2 Not convinced that you want to be taking Nixon's advice on this. Finally as an ancap I'm no longer right winger under new socialist definitions ?삚?쪈?쩃 free trader is leftist idea which makes me a leftist too I think Richard Nixon said it best when he said if we want to be a world-class country we have to have world-class goods and services. Free trade allows multinational corporations to export labor overseas, destroying domestic industries and increasing the exploitation of workers both at home and abroad. At home, because when these industries are gone the demand for domestic labor decreases and workers lose bargaining power. Corporations export labor overseas because it is cheaper. Thanks to this cheaper labor, they can bring their products to market for less money and pass on these cost savings to consumers. Yes, some people lose their jobs. Others have more money in their pockets because of the cost-savings passed on by the corporations, money that goes back into the economy and creates jobs.  The purpose of the economy isn't to create jobs, says Milton Friedman . We could create millions of jobs by banning the use of computers in offices, he says .  Friedman asked the guide why these workers weren't using modern equipment, to which the guide replied: ""It's to create jobs"" No economic policy, no matter how beneficial to a country, doesn't create some losers .  The question is this: Does free trade make us better off on net balance? The answer, according to the overwhelming majority of economists, is a resounding yes . Paul Krugman, certainly not a right-wing economist, once started a paper defending free trade with the words: If there were an Economist's Creed, it would surely contain the affirm Here is an analysis of a questionnaire sent to 210 Ph.D. economists that includes overwhelming agreement on free trade and the freeing of restrictions for corporations to outsource work abroad. Harvard economics professor Nicholas Gregory Mankiw once said: ""Few propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards.""  You don't seem to seem to understand the logic behind free trade at all . Many texts have a chapter on trade and explain why trade is good and explicitly say that it is . Abroad, because these corporations directly take advantage of horrible working conditions in countries where sweatshop workers are treated almost literally like slaves.  What people choose to do is a good indicator of what they value, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: Are they forced to work for sweatshops? What, exactly, is the alternative? Revealed preference teaches us that .  I am originally from a third-world country. I asked my friend if he couldn't get a job elsewhere. He told me he has been looking for months, with no luck . My cousin hasn't been paid in seven months. They both work for companies based in my country .  Nike ""sweatshops"" are ""slavery"" and ""exploitation,"" CNN's John Sutter says . Nike says it's ""tough out there, and that's why they can afford this BS"" Sutter: ""What do you think would happen if one of those Nike sweatshops landed in my home country?""  A huge portion of computer chip manufacturing for the whole world occurs in Taiwan . China can use that leverage to great effect if they take over . Free trade is bad for national security because it makes a country excessively dependent on things outside its control . If these national security threats due to free trade are predictable, then local entrepreneurs can take advantage in a variety of ways. They could keep manufacturing locally at a loss for a while until the country inevitably needs their products and recoup their losses by selling these products at exorbitant prices. Or, they could buy in bulk from the country that makes it, store it somewhere safe, and sell it at exorbitant prices when the inevitable happens and people need their products. If these threats are unpredictable, what exactly are you worried about? If China decides to no longer trade with us, it will become a race to buy chips elsewhere or it will suddenly become massively profitable to develop them locally. There will be a gold rush, competition will rise, prices will drop, and that will be the end of it. You also say that Free trade discourages expertise, innovation, and education. A country which offloads and neglects certain industries will not develop expertise in those fields, nor will it be capable of innovating in them. Why is this a bad thing? That's like saying that the division of labor discourages expertise, innovation, and education. A person who offloads and neglects certain careers will not develop expertise in those careers, nor will he be capable of innovating in them. Well, yes, because a person who tries to specialize in everything will be, at best, bad at most things. If everyone specializes in one thing, we have true experts who can give us products or services that are of far better quality than if we had tried to specialize in everything. Why should countries try to specialize in everything?  Some countries are net exporters of certain goods while also net importers of oil . The same way I am a net exporter of financial analysis and a net importer of medical knowledge . Or even in most things within one giant industry like tech? If we had a thriving semiconductor industry, we would be teaching students the relevant skills and knowledge. We don't need to have a thriving semiconductor industry to teach students the relevant skills and knowledge. This isn't like building the pyramids. More importantly, again, a country not being expert in literally everything, including every field of tech, isn't necessarily a bad thing. Demand for workers in high-tech industries produces demand for good education, and conversely lack of demand for high-skilled workers results in worse educational outcomes. Even if this is true, which I don't think it is, the semiconductor niche isn't the only part of the high-tech industry. We have plenty of demand for high-tech workers, last I checked, especially with AI starting to thrive. What percentage of MIT graduates are unemployed? Seriously, at the very least, let's catch up to the things modern economists believe and why they believe them. Then we can maybe argue whether they are right or wrong. This post does not even try to engage the arguments for one of the most well-established conclusions in the economic profession. There is no discussion anywhere of absolute or comparative advantage.

House prices dropped considerably, but after 1995 they went back up with only a hiatus between 2008-2013 when Philips did their expansions, they didn't choose Eindhoven because of insufficient housing. Philips even went ahead to build their own company housing, which wasn't enough to save the company... ASML isn?셳 leaving, they are just expanding elsewhere. All the stuff here remains but new stuff will be somewhere with a better business climate For a company like ASML, is nice/important to have a main residence because of easy communication lines (very complex modules so very specialized knowledge).

This chance is greatly increased if they choose to expand in Asia or America rather than Europe (where timezone compatibility makes it easier to cooperate between teams). My guess is, in the long term, ASML will move to the United States while Dutch politicians pander to the lowest common denominator.  The Brandevoort district of Helmond is developing rapidly . There is new commercial construction going on along the N270 . I bet a lot of these are ASML employees who moved before Helmond becomes too expensive . Will they move the entire company? I think they will only move the head office.  I don?셳 think they will leave all their production facilities. It?셲 just a tax thing I believe.  With the general upward trend on the housing market, even if ASML leaves I doubt there will be a significant drop.  Without ASML, for every person at asml, 10 are employed elsewhere in the Eindhoven region . Not all companies will go broke, but expect massive layoffs in the region . Most likely 100-150k people, many of which are not native to the region, will most likely look elsewhere . This massive exodus will have a big impact on VHV housing. VHV prices are abnormally high for what it is right now. If we compare to villages close to breda, you can expect a 30-50%ish price drop.  That said. ASML wont leave soon. Only years of incompetent politicians and their voters will cause it. This. There's still a growing housing shortage in the NL of about 400.000 and counting, regardless of ASML. ASML is not leaving, they are just going to build any new expansion elsewhere. where did you even hear they are moving...? This means part of engineering jobs will leave Netherlands and all of the companies in the area around Eindhoven. Because new produced parts will be sourced mostly locally. So lower investment, less high paying jobs. Wolfs sic market share decreased compared to 22 years ago Will there be more than 60 percent I dont think soIm so absorbed in the direction of the scifi that Im complacent in a short period of timeIve invested in it and I cant beat it like this even if its smashed

Oh my god Broadcom Rocks At AI Event: Here's What Got These Analysts Most Excited - Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Analyst Hans Mosesmann: ?쏷he setup between Nvidia?셲 (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI compute roadmap (GPU-centric, proprietary CUDA, Infiniband networking, and NVLink connectivity) and Broadcom?셲 ?쐎pen??standards (custom/merchant XPU, open Ethernet, open PCIe, history of power efficiency) is a battle of the titan?셲 over time,??he added. Keep in mind, AMD is pushing those PCIe open standards and had deep partnership with Broadcom in this area. Recently AMD released IP for infinity Frabric for Broadcom and other like Juniper which HPE is acquiring to build more robust direct to chip networking. https://www.servethehome.com/next-gen-broadcom-pcie-switches-to-support-amd-infinity-fabric-xgmi-to-counter-nvidia-nvlink/ I had been telling my friends that broadcom vs nVidia would be very interesting. Broadcom's network switch business is a big and high margin thing Pretty much the best candidate for Jesen to attack beyond AI. I'm not sure how Hock can really deal with that. He also joined meta's board last month..... Is it winner take all though? NVDA is a clear winner for performance, so I would allocate to training foundational model and heavy workloads. AVGO is clear winner in cost/power consumption, so I would make it my workhorse - inference, everyday workflows. It?셲 also very clear that NVDA is targeting enterprises as a whole vs just hyperscalers (as AVGO is solely focused on). Not really. Broadcom is a networking giant. Their custom chip business is just a small part of their total revenue. The big fight here is with Nvidia's Infinaban networking. Caught at the peak 187 sigh Agreed to the settlement
Sigh Congratulations on the surge 200 billion won in operating profit Oh get in Covered Calls on NVDA Someone made a post/poll a few weeks ago about selling covered calls which received mostly negative feedback I just wanted to get insight into why people are or are not selling covered calls to generate income on their existing shares, in particular anyone who has held NVDA shares for a long period of time.  Personally I have been selling weekly covered calls to generate income . I look historically and I don't see, outside earnings, where the stock moves 10% over a given week . If I were to spitball a number it would probably be less than 5% of the time . Even if you had to buy to close the position net-net you I'm long NVIDIA, I really believe in this company but I am really interested in getting other input. I apologize if this isn't a great format but here are the options positions I have taken this week.  I sold covered calls years go, thousands of shares, but I didn't replace them . Admittedly I did not understand options very well at the time and my bottom line was I got tired of losing the shares and the upside . Today the potential not realized on those share is measured in 7 figures. So you tell me was the periodic $thousands in income worth it? thank you Also thinking about it, but I promised myself not to get into options. Also I only have 40 shares right now??Also (3rd one) I live in Belgium where capital gains are not taxed unless you start real trading (like options or day trading), so I am not sure that I want my current +500% gains on NVDA being taxed. Wait until that split, baby! I'm selling weekly covered calls and trying to hit for an unattainable call. Yes this limits my PL but it's still PL at that point. I also hold long call positions in case of a major flare up to grab new shares if mine gets called. Have not had mine called yet Only 300 shares here. Selling CCs and have let them get taken away once or twice but overall outperforming buy and hold....for now I use the wheel strategy. Every week I sell ITM cash secured puts on NVDA. Since November, they expire OTM and I keep the premium. But when the shares do come to me, I sell covered calls on them. Nice thing about NVDA is you can price them far OTM and you still get a nice premium :) I think that was me. Yes, I am still doing covered calls, although, I sell only 1 or 2 contracts at max, whereas I hold 1100 stocks, could sell 11 at max. I am an extremely defensive player. So I set a price and number of contracts to a value where I am actually comfortable selling. Like 1 contract at $1100. As you agree with me, there is not that many good arguments to not do covered calls at least on a small scale. The risk can be from low to non-existent. I appreciate that, thank you. I really don't want to get my shares called away but for example the covered call I opened at the beginning of the week was around 24% below the strike price. I do believe I need to be very cautious though. Volatility seems to have gone down though. I sold a couple of 1050 3/22 calls last week for about $9.50. Today, 1050 3/28s are only $2.50.

Thank you in advance Nvda Can someone explain to me why NVDA isn?셳 gaining more than SMCI. The volume is higher on Nvda and SMCI goes up way more. I don?셳 get it.  NVDA is not a pump-and-dump stock so it?셲 just strange to see something getting such a massive amount of backing not go up like crazy . NVDA and all of its new partnerships shouldn't be up past the $1000 range by now? I?셫 not risking ny entire life savings in this or anything but watching the markets and historical movements based off of the past few months any good news like the Woodstock AI conference should have driven this stock up well past 1000 already and it?셲 not even holding past 925 right now.  NVDA recently has been struggling to earn anything past 20 . SMCI is moving around 80-100 a day give or take and NVDA is moving about 80 to 100 a day .  Can someone give an honest reasoning to maybe help me understand and if you don't, I would greatly appreciate it . So if you have a website or something I could look up, maybe divulge in some reading so I can better understand this . Because nvidia is at over 2 trillion market cap while Smci is at 50 billion As a new trader, I suggest you stop trying to figure out why stocks move the way they do, because there is literally no valid answer other than supply and demand. NVDA is up 85% this year, SMCI is up over 300%. Not sure what more you expect from a stock. Supply and demand does not exist....see ken griffin(citadel) statement:we drive the price where we think the companies should be valued. At the moment the stock market is the biggest fraud That makes sense. I can admit to having the wrong mindset towards it. so that is a helpful tip, thank you. And I get that?셲 a lot of movement and I?셶e been watching them both over a few months. I guess what?셲 surprising to me is that NVDA isn?셳 gaining more than it is after all their partnerships that were recently announced I thought that was going to move the markets like never before. Now, I probably am looking in the wrong places when hearing these things. I get the information from other Reddit threads. But again as a newer trader I don?셳 necessarily know exactly where to look. See ?쏮arket Cap??$NVDA  NVDA was trading in the 400?셲 right before its last earnings day . NVDA kept going down leading up to that day, even a couple days after earnings . If you bought after that then it?ä� ok that it?�� not moving much. It just went up A LOT. The trick to this is if The pump is over. It's flat now. Institutions are collecting their profits by selling. Waiting on the next wave of news so it can keep climbing. AI can stop global warming, cure diseases, increase crop yield, solve war... Market cap and free float Someone explain to me why AMD is being shorted so much??since ath. Can?셳 even see where bottom is. Seems unjustified. NVDA is 40x the size of SMCI by market cap. Think about the difference in flexibility in handling a freight truck vs a mini cooper. It just needs to beat earning again in May and it will pump again Be skeptical of what you read. Writers are paid to write. someone interested in manipulating stock prices may be paying them. Mostly no one can predict what will happen in the short term- or the long term. There are too many variables and too many opportunities for something unexpected to complicate the picture. Both of these stocks have had huge run ups. To the point where some people are worried about being invested in them. That worry may be part of what is ?쐆olding them back?? And that may be a good thing. SMCI is volatile There?셲 one theory in 3 words: efficient market hypothesis (look it up for fun weekend reading) another theory: nobody knows just place your bet and hold on Stock market moves in anticipation of things. Typically those with high growth ?쐏rice in??that growth way ahead of time. Think about the psychology of it. Marketcap.

At least share the loss porn oh lord this stock is gonna reach fucking mars They were bought by someone, but they were also sold by someone else, otherwise there would not trade, amirite? The buyer: a market maker, someone who was already short calls to reduce exposure or go flat, someone hedging a short position in the stock, someone who wants to bet in an upside in the stock The seller: a market maker, someone who owns stock and wants to get rid of it, someone speculating that the stock could go down, someone who bought the calls earlier and is selling them for profit. The simpleton thesis that these are BOUGHT by some speculator is hopium combined with ignorance, which is a nice combo, to be honest.  The stock was following a normal downward trend towards the end of the day and then suddenly inverted and rallied from $934 to $944 at around 3.35pm (when those calls started being traded) This suggests that some market-maker was delta-hedging the calls sold . Edit: hadn't even noticed that half hit the bid (sold to MMs) half hit the ask (bought from MMs) as shown by the _B and the _A details. This is a nothing burger, just regular trades.

The volatility is extreme Ban $NVDA from WSB Hello degens, I know you're all fucked up because it's the weekend and the stonk market is closed but hopefully the Wendy's is busy enough to keep you preoccupied until Monday. This subreddit is unfortunately being over run with people ONLY talking about one stock and it's destroying our moral fabric. $NVDA I think NVDA should be permanently banned from WSB.  NVDA is ruining WSB. I believe this new fad that's come from the semiconductor pump is destroying wallstreetbets ""old stock"" culture . The subreddit is overrun by twentysomething YO trust fund babies who've never worked a day in their life . When I was 21 I started investing in the TSX venture exchange. It's basically a Canadian penny stock nightmare riddled with pump and bull shit. Mining junior? We're gonna steal your fucking money and lie to you about when we're gonna start production/never go into production. Graphine? Yeah, I got lucky on that one and figured out it was a pump and dump and flipped it twice, both times for a double. Cell phone company with prepaid cards? Pump and dump again... Lost 1000 bucks on some company that was supposed to sell a ton of prepaid cell phone minutes to people with bad credit. Anyways, the point I'm trying to make is all CEO's and insiders suck and they're all basically gonna fuck you out of your money. It's always a zero sum game. So fucking figure it out quick or you're gonna lose money. I eventually started becoming profitable at trading but also found out that one of the mining companies I owned was basically involved in slavery. Look it up... Nevsun resources. So I'm just saying maybe my stock was up 30% for that reason.  The best pump and dump one that EVER got me was a potash company KRN.TO listed on the almighty TORONTO STOCK exchange . CEO Robin Phinney comes on BNN and pumps this fucking shit up to like 20 bucks or something after I'd bought in at like 5 and then for some reason even though they 0 sum game. Anyways I'm going to get on with my point here. There is a severe lack of meaningful YOLO's. People that don't even fucking read the rules... I see 20-30 YOLO's a week posted with only 2k on the table. I think it's a 10k min for options. I lost 2k USD this week alone on $AMD. That's a lot of money for me but no body fucking cares. I don't even care. There's a severe lack of meaningful discussion. There's a severe lack of meaningful memes. There's not enough shitty TA in the sub anymore and it's upsetting. No one wants to see your 100k NVDA leaps yolo from your half million+ dollar account. Go try and fucking trade options on a stock with an ACTUAL spread. Can we get some DD in here instead of 1000 people posting the picture of Cocaine Cramer and the leather jacket guy eating each other's asses? What the fuck is this pussy bullshit? And what the fuck are the mods doing not moderating? Are you mods (assholes) too busy offloading your $RDDT shares or are you guys just sucking each other's dicks like usual? I'm talking to you opinion you dumb fuck. Ban $NVDA now. It's only fair. Position: $NVDA 910p next week. Join WSB Discord Price of entry too high for us poors. Ruiner of households.

You dont have to worry about the expansion because its a soft war company it might be possible to have an operating profit margin of about 70 Help me understand this NVDA Trade According to the image when taken (now it should be different of course) I sell a 935 put and get about 1935 of premmium collected, then I buy a PUT at 925 and pay 1510 so my net profit between the premiuns should be about 425. The preview says Max return for the trade 390 and max loss 609. My questions are. Do I need 609 to start the position? If the diference between the premiums are 390 how my loses can be 609? [trade.png](https://postimg.cc/sQ5Y23rj)  This is a put credit spread . You don't sell then 935 and then buy the 925, you trade them both in one order . The separate premiums of the individual legs don't really matter, just the net credit you receive . my net profit between the premiuns should be about 425. This is incorrect. ""Credit you receive when you sell something"" is not ""profit."" If you buy 100 shares of stock at 20 and sell them at 30, do you get $3000 ""profit?"" No, profit is the difference between the amount of money you get when you sell and the amount you pay when you buy. The max profit on a credit spread is the credit you received to open. I'm not sure why there is a discrepancy here between its thinking the order is going to fill at 4.10, and your max profit being $390. If the order fills at 4.10, your max profit is $410 (minus fees.) You need $1000 in buying power (the difference between the strikes, times 100) to open the position.  Your max loss on a credit spread occurs if it expires with both legs ITM . If that happens, the net result is that you are debited the difference between the strikes . Subtract the credit you received to open, $410, and your max loss is $590 . Wish I had known you were covering this already. I was writing at the same time, but you beat me to the submit button by a fraction of a minute. One additional question. If the price ends at 930, he will be obligated to buy for 935 but not be able to sell at 925, am I right? So a lot to unpack here.  The best-case price the short put would be 19.35, but it's unlikely you will get that price . Even if you could use the value of the individual legs, you are reading the wrong values . For single-legged sell to open trades, it's more conservative to use the bid, so a 19.20 credit instead of Second, brokers typically use the midpoint (mark) of the bid/ask spread to estimate gain/loss, so $390 max return is probably based on the mark prices. Again, these are just guesses, so if they are a little off either way, that is to be expected. Do I need 609 to start the position? It depends on what you mean by ""start the position"". I want to say no, because it sounds like you think you need to pay that much as a debit, but the little blue box at the top shows you would open the trade for a credit. You would receive $410 in cash, if the order fills (it probably won't for those prices). However, if you meant, how much buying power do you need, yes, that would be the spread width minus the opening credit. Since it is $10 wide and the credit is $4.10, you need $6.90 in buying power. If the diference between the premiums are 390 how my loses can be 609? Max loss on a credit spread is the spread width of $10 minus the opening credit. make sure you paper trade for a while and don't go live until you understand EXACTLY the implications of your trade and how you will EXIT Put Credit spread - Project Finance Research credit spreads or specifically Bull Put or Put Credit spreads. Check out OptionRecom too. The comments here are great. There are other popular trading threads (that I won't mention) have attracted people who only reply with sarcastic or demeaning comments. I appreciate the knowledge displayed  If the market moves against you overnight or over the weekend you, say down to 900, you will lose the difference between 930 - 900 times number of contracts . Please keep in mind that you can lose way more than ?äääax loss??if the stock closes in between the strikes . Great write ups by the Moderators here btw??$NVDA What app shows you all that info? Thats pretty cool. TD sucks the bag  ALEXEVH, I try to simplify the potential outcome of these 2 legs . If NVDA closes on 3/28/24 > $935, both puts expire worthless & you realize the max return of $410.90 . Any price above $930.90 will make money for you . Hey bro How far will it go Honestly isnt this a big bubble Congratulations JUJUStill this kind of company is crazy Im going all in on Samsung tomorrow Wow its terrible Im on board Lets just eat 10 and buy it Is Micron a Korean company My wife Chey TaewonYou can sell it to Hynixs MeCooking KnifeThen the calculation will be right
Im glad Micron took over Hanick NVDA VERY possible split in 2024 We all heard the talk about a possible split this year.NVDA has split 5 times in its history and the last one in 2021 at 740. The current price is higher than that and met some resistance today heading toward $1000. (I honestly believe the big money guys (Hedge Funds, Private Equity) are doing this ON PURPOSE for whatever reason.) Do you think the split will be  Cramer pressed the issue, reminding Huang that Nvidia had done stock splits in the past . Huang also highlighted potential benefits: ""We want to take care of our employees"" He just gave us the answer RIGHT THERE meaning ""We WILL do this........eventually, but not at this moment"" Jensen already said it is coming but he didn't say when When did he say it's coming?  A split would be awesome but if I take that quote that he said, ?쐗e?셪l think about it, then it more so just sounds to me like they weren?Â�� really planning on it and kinda just wanna move past the topic . The HF are definitely doing this they are the only ones that can move the stock . I doubt they do much more then a 10-1 split z Did you just say you think the private equity guys are messing with a public stock? I?셫 feeling a 7-1 Oh more expensive than Hynix Sales are only half as high as Hynix and the profit rate is lowerThe market capitalization is much higher than Hynix

AMAT could see a price appreciation to $250-$300 in the next 6-12 months . AMAT is one of the few quote ""pick and shovel"" companies of the semiconductor industry . Any Thoughts or Questions about my DD is much appreciated Join WSB Discord Solid growth. Announcements don't look priced. I nabbed a month-out call. What are your positions? none, no money in the market at all, I'm broke. If you want strong arms buy some AMAT. Likes to just go sideways after whipsawing. Leaving you holding a heavy bag. Took me nearly 2 months to get back in the green with them. when did you buy/sell? I've been bullish since I bought it for $12 per share in March 2009. Never sold. The dividend yield on the original investment is 13.3%. Earnings on 5/16 AMAT is one of those stocks where all DD for me has always failed, the stock has always looked good but not enough price moment Lam Research, ASML, and Applied Mat all do diff things. They are not ?쐓trong competitors?? Sold on the DD pe is in the 20s, not bad compared to peers. Bro is now bullish at the top None of those companies are competitors of AMAT fyi, they make different processes Got in 2021 off a fluke. .hehe Keep going up overwhelming appreciation Left without giving time to escape I cant believe its flying without being pressed Micron and Hynix What does it matterDo you know anyone We should also consider HBM profitability Micron is also very profitableWill I watch it YouTube as a referencehttpsyoutubeLvghhaWGMvMsisFHgQ7dlcgaJ2gVx
If you cant click on the link watch the latest video on the YouTube stock119 channel Wer tr채gt die Verantwortung, wenn ein selbstgebautes Gew채chshaus auf Schulgrund zusammenbricht?  Ich bin FSJlerin (18f) und plane mit meiner Klasse und dem Lehrer ein Gew채chshaus in einem anliegenden Garten zu bauen . Dieser Garten wird sowohl von uns, als auch anderen Klassen und Ein Projekt ist f체r ein FSJ verpflichtend. Das Gew채chshaus wird 2m x 3m x 2m aus einem Holzger체st werden. Meine Frage ist: was passiert, wenn dieses Gew채chshaus jemandem auf dem Kopf zusammenbricht? Wer tr채gt die Verantwortung? K철nnte ich da Probleme kriegen? (Der Bauplan wurde von meinem Opa 체berarbeitet, welcher als Ingenieur auf dem Bau gearbeitet hat. Der Lehrer hat auch einiges an Erfahrung - macht auch Unterrichtsstunden in einer Metallwerkstatt) Hatte bereits bei Lehrer nachgefragt, dieser meinte, die beauftragte vom Garten. Sie hab ich dann auch gefragt und sie meinte keine Ahnung, aber wird schon nichts passieren.. Edit: Die Fl채che vom Garten geh철rt der Stadt - der Garten an sich wird aber von einem Verein als Projekt genutzt (Ort zum kennenlernen etc). Die Frau scheint (nach Internetrecherche) die beauftragte f체r das Projekt Garten zu sein. Meine und die andere Schulen sind lediglich Kooperationspartner. 횆ndert diese Info etwas an euren Aussagen? Danke! Amtshaftungsgrundsatz. Wenns n offizielles Schulprojekt ist, haftet die Schule, genauer der Schultr채ger, im Au횩enverh채ltnis zB bei verletzten Kindern. Ein Durchgriff von externen Dritten auf Besch채ftigte einer Beh철rde ist ausgeschlossen. Im Innenverh채ltnis kann der Dienstherr gegen die Besch채ftigten bei Vorsatz oder grober Fahrl채ssigkeit Regress fordern. die Frage ist daher, in welchem Rechtsverh채ltnis der FSJler zur Schule steht. Und sofern federf체hrend ein regul채rer Besch채ftigter der Beh철rde f체r das Projekt zust채ndig ist, wird den FSJler sowieso keine Verantwortung treffen. Es wird erst wirklich problematisch, wenn du grob fahrl채ssig gehandelt hast... was hier nur schwer vorstellbar ist und daf체r sollte man auch eine passende Haftpflichtversicherung haben. Hinzu kommt, dass es ja eine Beauftragte f체r das Projekt gibt. Diese ist f체r das Projekt zust채ndig. Die Schulleitung an deiner Schule wird ja ebenfalls 체ber dein Projekt informiert sein. Dass das am Ende irgendwie an dir h채ngen bleiben k철nnte, halte ich f체r ziemlich unwahrscheinlich. Toll, dass du dir so viele Gedanken darum machst :) Ansonsten wurde die Frage hier schon beantwortet. Du haftest nicht, da die endg체ltige Entscheidungsgewalt nicht bei dir, sondern beim Lehrer bzw. am Ende bei der Schulleitung liegt. Aber noch mal - wirklich super, dass du dir so viel M체he gibst und das alles durchdenkst, noch mal mit deinem Opa gesprochen hast usw. Der Lehrer, der daf체r verantwortlich und danach nat체rlich auch die Schule. Du tr채gst keine Verantwortung. Du hast ja nicht die entg체ltige Entscheidungsgewalt. Da in letzter Zeit viele Posts gel철scht werden, nachdem die Frage von OP beantwortet wurde und wir m철chten, dass die Posts f체r Menschen mit 채hnlichen Problemen recherchierbar bleiben, hier der urspr체ngliche Post:  Ich bin FSJlerin (18f) und plane mit meiner Klasse und dem Lehrer ein Gew채chshaus in einem anliegenden Garten zu bauen .

Then come back here to pre-school explain what it all means: https://www.micron.com/ one of the visuals you'll find: Now that you've enjoyed the pretty pictures and big fat fonts, we pre-school explain it further here for your pre-school reading pleasure.  Micron is what I've loaded on. If you haven't heard of the legendary rabbit+zoo they pulled out of their hat this last earnings, you don't deserve to call yourself an ape trader, you're more like a caculus spider monkey . March 20th 2024, that magical date... sigh.... Q2 2024 : Earnings per share: 42 cents adjusted vs. 25 cent loss expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Revenue: $5.82 billion vs. 5.35 billion expected by LSEG. Micron said revenue rose to $5.82 billion from $3.69 billion in the year ago quarter. The company reported a net income of $793 million, up from a net loss of $2.3 billion in the same period last year. (ohhh and that pretty guidance into next Qtr.... ) For its fiscal third quarter, Micron expects to report revenue of $6.6 billion, above the $6.02 billion expected by analysts. ( these mofo's will be busy for YEARS to come pumping out the storage capacity for the AI revolution ) ?쏻e believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multi-year opportunity enabled by AI,??Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a release. Micron has long provided memory and flash storage for computers, data centers and phones. Large data centers are used to power the influx of new AI software. While Nvidia has grabbed much of the spotlight for its graphics processing units that run AI, companies like Micron benefit by providing the memory and storage for those systems.

Now check out what Micron does: Check out this premonition anouncement A YEAR OLD on their wicked SOLID STATE SUPER MASSIVE STORAGE FOR DATA CENTERS:  Micron 9400 NVMe??SSD is in volume production and immediately available from channel partners and to global OEM customers . The drive delivers an industry-leading 30.72 terabytes (TB) of storage capacity, superior workload performance versus the competition . Leading storage performance excels in a range of environments from AI to cloudThe Micron 9400 SSD sets a new performance standard for PCIe Gen4 storage by delivering 1.6M IOPS for 100% 4K random reads. The Micron 9400?셲 capacity and performance enable larger datasets and accelerate epoch time, the total number of iterations of data in one cycle for training machine learning models ??leading to more efficient utilization of graphics processing units (GPUs). While many SSDs are designed for pure read or write use cases, the Micron 9400 was designed with real-world applications in mind. Mixed workloads are prevalent in many data center applications, including caching, online transaction processing, high-frequency trading, AI, and performance-focused databases requiring extreme performance. For mixed read and write workloads, the Micron 9400 also outperforms the competition, providing: 71% higher IOPS for 90% read and 10% write workloads, surpassing 1 million IOPS4 69% higher IOPS for 70% read and 30% write workloads, surpassing 940,000 IOPS4 In testing scenarios, the Micron 9400 SSD excelled in mixed workload performance compared against competitors??high-performance NVMe SSDs. The results show: For RocksDB, a storage database renowned for its high performance and used for latency-sensitive, user-sensitive applications like spam detection or storing viewer history, the 9400 delivered up to 23% higher performance and up to 34% higher workload responsiveness5 For Aerospike Database, an open-source NoSQL database optimized for flash storage, the Micron 9400 demonstrated up to 2.1 times higher peak performance and superior responsiveness. Aerospike Database underpins time-critical web applications like fraud detection, recommendation engines, real-time payment processing and stock trading ??meaning the 9400 can deliver faster results for these time-sensitive use cases5 For NVIDIA Magnum IO GPUDirect Storage which enables a direct memory access data transfer path between GPU memory and storage, the Micron 9400 beat the competition by delivering 25% better performance in a busy system with compute-bound tasks ??a critical improvement for AI environments6 For multi-tenant cloud architectures, the Micron 9400 delivers more than double the overall performance of a competitor?셲 performance-focused SSD and up to 62% better response time6 This is a YEAR AGO. Now check this shit out: First a little terminology: High-bandwidth memory (HBM) version 3E (HBM3E) is the latest standard for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) SDRAM. It's used in high-performance installations like graphics accelerators, data center processors, and AI accelerators. HBM3E uses a stacked die format, with the CPU and HBM memory stack on the same interposer/package substrate. And Microns Official intro to their HBM3E: HIGH-BANDWIDTH MEMORY The industry's fastest, highest-capacity high-bandwidth memory (HBM) to advance generative AI innovation Link to their page: https://www.micron.com/products/memory/hbm/hbm3e?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw5ImwBhBtEiwAFHDZxx09Cbkrsl6T_QadrkfcJuoaclcro2yubnncuoVpXRzCYGCnL00kEhoCQ04QAvD_BwE Today?셲 generative AI models require an ever-growing amount of data as they scale to deliver better results and address new opportunities.

2024-03-27,ASML the Next stock in the AI market move Who is asml Il keep this simple They are a leader in the manufacturing of chip making equipment Companies like Intel and TSMC buy their equipment to make chip plants Why is ASML so interesting Cause they are making the world first 2 nano meter lithography machines that really fucking small and enables next level AI chips and memory Per the article below they are already sold out to Intel and others and are expanding their capacity Il keep this straightforward Nvidia and Micron Intel  etc all need this tech to make more and more powerful AI chips httpswwwlinkedincompulseasmllaunchhighnalithographymachine2nmchipmanufacturingi9dacutmsourceshareutmmediummemberiosutmcampaignsharevia Risks this 2 na tech is brand new and very cutting edge There maybe delays as it gets production ramped up as TSM and others evaluate and work through kinks Now let look at the stock It at all time highs and isn cheap with a PE of 44 vs 75 for NVDIA Note it actually have a dividend yield at 68 So the metrics are a little expensive but not really stretched I expect their next earnings call April 17 to be a huge catalyst as 2na adoption is discussed TLDR These guys have the shit every chip mfg is going to have to have to compete for the most advanced AI processors and memory This is a hovels and mortarplay for AI and will be a slower stock rise than others but should see another 50 in the next year as people see 2na chip machines get bought Near term catalyst is April 17 earnings call Note there are real risks with chip tech this advanced I wouldn YOLO it but if you want to be more risky i would do some slightly out of the money option plays if your due diligence agrees with mine around April 17 Personally i am doing stock for now Join

tab along with South Koreas SK Hynix 000660KS opens new tab was set to add nearly 16 billion to its market value based on its share price of 11092 Im not sure if itll reach 180 but Ive made good money on them from the begining of the year Just how frothy is Nvidias stock Seems like Nvidias stock is taking a bit of a dip after a strong run with shares edging down following a stumble the other day Despite the excitement around its new Blackwell chips which I believe was already going to be priced in people are speculating that the stock might lose a bit of steam as retail traders look for more action in the market Currently Nvidia shares are sitting at around 900 With the buzz from Nvidias recent developer event still fresh it seems like there arent any major new drivers pushing the stock forward right now Personally I keeping an eye on EPS and PE ratio which is bordering the ait a minutelevel for me One interesting observation is that the attention of retail traders who have been driving a lot of the recent market frenzy might be shifting away from Nvidia for the time being As always theres also speculation about whether Nvidia might join the memestock frenzy with a stock split to make its shares more appealing to retail investors So far though I havent seen any signs of this happening What do you guys think about the stock medium to longterm growth and price target Trying to get more opinions on this Retail is so small compared to institutional and is not a major impact on the stock price This isnt GME PCE is Friday Youe correct but it become a bit of a selffulfilling prophecy Big money managers can see predicting retail as having an edge in the market which leads to them shadowing similar moves Not always sometimes retail does really dumb things but worth paying attention to Yeah I get your point Just a quick observation because I read that specific part about retail investors on two different financial news articles now which I found odd Youe looking at the backward looking PE for a company that is growing at a historical rate YoY The forward PE is under 40 So ya it pretty frothy but not if they can sustain their growth lol I would go as far as to say that a historical PE is completely irrelevant when a company is doubling revenue and expanding profit margins lol With NVDAs growth the fact that they are the only game in town for chips that run machine learning and generative AI the fact that they provide the full software stack to a huge loyal base of developers how exactly do you think a forward PE of about 40 is overvalued I heard similar arguments about AMZN back in the day when its forward PE was around 200 Yet the stock quintupled from those levels over the next few years NVDA stock is up over 80 this year over 120 since November over 700 from its 2022 low Even the market leader needs some time to breathe now and then I believe NVDA can be a 2000 stock this year and 3000 next year based on current revenue projections which frankly may be on the light side If this stock gets back to the 700s by some act of the market gods I am backing up the truck part of their secret sauce is kinda like what windows is for the pc world in that most of the software are written for the their plateform A small but important distinction is that their moat is the training phase after that the there are a a few competitors that are building chips that can do the generative part A good example is groq  not to be confused with Musks grog its super fast and you can even try it out for free on their website using the llama models for meta Forward PE for fiscal 2025 this calendar year is 36 Its forward 3 year annual PEG ratio is 217 so its getting expensive but big tech tends to be around 2 forward PEG using this equation during a bull market just my observation Equation Forward years  current year annual EPS estimate the following year and the year after that Growth rate  the EPS CAGR of those

the EPS estimates will be revised up throughout the year by new partnership announcements Keep making investing decisions based on PE and youll be always late to the party Seems like you havent priced inlooked at the growth potential EPS and PE is cheaper at 800 in Feb than it was at 500 in November Tell that to the stock right now 3rd Company by market cap and you comparing Nvidia with meme stocks bravo I glad you read the part about me not seeing that happening The pump is far from over NVDA peak PE in 2021 and 2022 was 58 and 78 So based on your logic it rothy But look how predictive those numbers were 23yrs later How much would you have gained if you bought during those frothiest prices in 2021 and 2022 Price it high but AI trend is still up and running and that ebitda it wow awesome also It will depend on how it keeps growing specially in new areas Medium teerm hover 8001000 once it breaks 1000 it will continue to get to 1500 Its running the same course as crypto a few years ago With the way sales are looking not as frothy as you think I have no position in NVDA but I think it has more room to run tbh not many anticipated the scale of advancement they made with Blackwell over their own Hopper series of chips I dont think it was priced in and the way the share has been failing to approach 1k means that institutions are still taking their time to digest what Jensen announced at the GTC If they can keep up deliveries and not walk back on those specs they will keep having stellar earnings for the short term future I doubt at these prices retail traders are moving the needle

net bank immediately after making the txn  For example with my ICICI credit cards  after every txn  it takes 1 day or more for that txn to show up in the txn history page of the iMobile app  But in case of OneCard  you can immediately see all the latest txns immediately Are there other banks which have this instant update feature  IDFC instantly updates them HDFC updates the transaction details immediately on their app It like making an UPI transaction So does sbi and hsbc Just shows up as unbilled for the first 2 days The most simple and easiest to track rewards and transactions are of Amex I have used the following banks  icici hdfc SBI Kotak axis AU Can you tell me if HDFC also updates instantly  AMex Doesnt everyone do it except the international ones You have to check unbilled txna not normal ones Icici shows unbilled transactions in netbanking not app Sbi Card which i have does it in app as well Don know how because for my ICICI coral card  txns take 1 day to show up in the app  sometimes even more  Also not all txns show up  only some random txns Scapia does it really fast I think Finally going up Oh my I trusted you NVDA trend short term Opinion discussion Some people I reckon do not fully understand the scope of NVIDIA still With the skies clear it should be smooth sailing and if it is just going sideways primarily it may indicate that lack of understanding Events may have hyped investors and overblown the estimate of peoples gauge in understanding its potential Its potential is huge and that is not just speculation but an active trend Doesn mattert will be cheap  1kshare in 8 months 3 more earnings and that all that matters to me I bought both the dips to 860 and 900 If somehow we get the fortune of 830 or less then Il buy again I don think wel be waiting for 1000 nearly as long as others seem to think we will Traders are still bullish on NVIDIA and it been holding its 900 support rather consistently Whether itl bounce from here is beyond me but it certainly won plummet down past 850 anytime soon If by some freak incident it does that would be great I expect to see it touching 1000 but not surpassing around earnings in May I will continue to trade the fluctuations with this thesis in mind Short term consolidation Noob here what meant by consolidation Meaning holding steady price for a while I am rather hesitant about the direction of Nvidia currently since the profit taking on March 8 we have seen rises and falls the short sellers are having fun with the nvidia stock and taking money without risk GTC did not contribute so much except for one recommendation or another which had no significant effect just a bump the day before and Blackwell was already known to everyone For the quarterly results in May the good news is already assimilated we all know its going to be very good but I think the market has already bought this result My only hope right now is to have excellent news from the FED which announces a date for the rate cut The good news is never priced in fully I will say that I would bet on it that there will be movement during earnings It could be pump and sell the news but then should rebound up if it is sell the news Short sellers suck on NVDA Go bulls I think theyll keep rates for some time We will see Next meeting is coming up but theyll probably say the same thing is my guess What figure do you think it may hit by mid year JuneJuly It doesn matter In the price range of 900 to  somewhere around there or so ASICS will take over just like they did with bitcoin There are already asic chips for commonly used training schemes Nividia or amd So i was originally gonna get a amd gpu but then i asked my older brother who is good with stuff like this and he said i should get a Nividia gpu since they are re reliable and fasterand vidia gpus will last longer than amdbut the best nividia gpu i can fit in my budget is a 4060 ti and the best amd gpu i can fit in my budget is a 6800 xt maybe a rx 6900 xt so what should i do the card wont be more reliable just because the chip is from nvidia youll have driver and software issues on both nvidia has faster products overall but if you get less faster cards for the same amount of money then the argument of who hast the crown doesnt concern you the card that is faster will probably last you longer so get the fastest card that your budget allows the 6800xt is great and beats the 4060ti by a long shot the 4060ti is one of the most disappointing products since the radeon VII your older brother is just repeating marketing phrases he bought into the brand and stopped looking at the products Ah i see Well thats what i was thinking too but he kept trying to convince me that nividia will be faster even tho its a 4060 ti Im glad i get more opinions on this situation so thanks AMD Your brothers frame of reference is either non existent or extremely small and based on ignorance 6800 xt is better than a 4060 ti so go for 6800 xt Donfall into what is better arguments Get the best gpu your budget can get no matter AMD or Nvidia Considering the price of a 6800 xt can you go for the 7900 gre That should be the best for the budget Well the thing is im kinda going off used prices since i dont really care if its used or not but i could go a rx 6800 non xt brand new but i think going used would be the better option Not true Nvidia is just better at ray tracing well alot better but a premium cost Amd is just as reliable and almost as fast as nvidia best card Speed is relative to cost 500 amd will typically be faster than 500 Nvidia since amd is more bang for buck I wouldnt necessarily say Nvidia is more reliable than amd but it is more broadly supported What depends more is the type of gaming you intend on and what you want to do with that gaming 1080p 2k or 4k Online multiplayer shooters Racing games Single player rpgs etc Also how important is Ray Tracing to you Some people swear by it but most turn it on enjoy it for sometime then eventually disable it in favor of better framerates depending on your gaming type Ie Online shooters benefit more from having it disabled to get more power into performance I have got alot of good feedback from you guys and im very thankful I have decided to go with amd since ray tracing dlss etc is not that important to me im really just looking for the best and most performance with the 1000 budget i have and if anyone is woundering what my build is its this httpspcpartpickercomlistCPwYYN and also im buying the rx 6900 xt used so its not 1000 like it says I gotta tell you I generally prefer Nvidia when theyre competitive with AMD But anything below 550 or a 4070 and AMD is a lot better for the price 6800xt and 6900xt are way better than a 4060ti Thats an easy decision IMHO No offense but your brothers spewing straight up bs The only reason youll need to go for Nvidia specifically is if you need it for your production tasks like 3D for example or Ray Tracing which not a lot of games are really optimized for plus youll need atleast a 4070ti to truly enjoy what ray tracing has to offer anyway If its for gaming theres no real difference between both companies so always go for whichever is affordable for you and 9 times out of 10 for this generation that would be AMD For your case its definitely the right decision to go for a 6800xt or 6900xt if you can reach it rather than the 4060ti Youre the best Thoughts of going to hell LOL m can we have Noctua AMD gpu have Noctua AMD gpu at homeCriticism more than welcome  this was my first time doing something like this",10

2024-04-02," The US government has transferred over 30,170 Bitcoin (approximately $2 billion) from the Silk Road hack fund to The Silk Road BTC address (linked to the US government) moved 2,000 Bitcoin ($131M) to Coinbase Prime and 29,800 Bitcoin ($1.95B) to a new address 8 hour ago. This is likely an OTC deal and does not directly affect the BTC spot price. They still hold 179.19K BTC ($11.7B) in the old wallets. Details: https://platform.spotonchain.ai/en/entity/188?route=view_transaction&chain_id=2110000000&txn_hash=b614dd2e0fa06d776ee4d45973fab5ceb6e2dfebfb84e5f7bd45ef0975455240 Now the crazy part about this story is that they transferred 30,170 Bitcoin (approximately $2 billion) with no regulations or paperwork like the bank does.  Imagine if you wanted to transfer that amount of money by using the bank ?쁻, they would have freaked out and asked you everything about this transaction . They would need to ask their bosses to come and see you directly, and you would have to sign A LOT of papers to get through . If I were to risk losing my money between the bank and cryptocurrency, I would choose cryptocurrency because I can have control over it. I wouldn't have to wait for the bank to retrieve it for me or follow their instructions on what to do next, especially since they can be unreliable. What side are you on? Bitcoin pros & cons with related info are in the collapsed comments below. That place I used to (allegedly) spend 5+ BTC on mid weed to be delivered to me hidden in a DVD case? Thats where all the escrow BTC went? I watch 2 movies in the morning I watch 2 movies at night I watch 2 movies in the afternoon It makes me feel alright The ol??dvd case decoy.. How hilarious would it be if they fucked up the transfer and burned that $2b in btc. Janet! How do we print more Bitcoin? Isn't it the US Marshal's Service who are handling it? I am just imagining some gruff Sam Elliott type in a ten gallon hat and a big moustache hunting and pecking the wallet address while getting instructions over the phone from his nephew that used to work at Best Buy. Do you think they will be paying taxes on their transactions? Who's in charge of sending these transactions? Could you imagine if someone fat fingered the wallet address and just sent it to the void? That would be awesome for small fry like us. If btc whales lost their warchest to the void there will be almost no external supply. There would be no one selling btc except some exchange. Taxable event for the government. ?Ⅸ If someone have that much money, whatever bank fee cost will be only tickle their ass Crazy how this is the only comment that says this. Says a lot about the knowledge of real world finances in this sub really. Customers with small bank accounts pay charges, customers with large accounts pay nothing or negligible fees. The bank makes hardly anything from small accounts which is why there are fees. They make a lot from big accounts so they waive the fees. If you won a large amount of money you'd see how quickly the bank would go from charging you to suddenly being your best friend offering you favours. I thought they believed btc has zero value and they don't need it. The hypocrisy It?셲 money they seized.. they didn?셳 buy btc. Ffs.. Rookie move. They should be keeping all ?쐔heir?쒫itcoin for when the USD collapses Bitcoin will collapse as well if the USD collapses. At least at first and most likely regardless. It could still affect price later considering the US did announce its plans to sell these illicit gains off in numerous transactions to break it apart in the next couple years they dont plan to hold any of it Problem is, when you deposit into a bank it is no longer, technically, your money... It becomes a loan to the bank and they use it"" to fund ""business""... They have X amount of money in deposits so they can borrow Y amount of money and effectively sell that debt to you as loans."" Hopefully they are paying that off the national debt but I?셫 sure it?셲 probably making a few rich fucks richer somehow $INTC as serious AI inference play  The real money is in datacenters and AI, specifically AI accelerators and inference chips for training / running models quickly . Nvidia has been the king with their monopoly-like features . Intel is making some serious moves .  Intel's Gaudi 2 is showing impressive results in the latest MLPerf benchmark . The chip has a massive 1.42x jump in performance compared to their previous gen in just one year . The generative AI market is estimated to hit $1.3 trillion by 2032, and we're in a unique position to guess who will be selling the shovels. As a bonus: Intel will be hugely susceptible to being hyped up during an AI bubble. Besides all this, we know that the Biden admin just announced Intel is getting up to $8.5B in direct funding under the CHIPS Act, along with a 25% tax credit on over $100B in investments and eligibility for $11B in federal loans. Intel could be a hedge against Nvidia, as they rely on TSMC. If geopolitical shit hits the fan, it could affect TSMC, which would impact Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and many others leaving intel as the only serious option. TLDR: Intel's AI Chip is no Nvidia killer yet, but Intel's making solid progress. $INTC could be an interesting AI play. Pie is big enough. [1] https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/03/28/mlperf-inference-4-0-results-showcase-genai-nvidia-still-dominates/ Join WSB Discord Intel?셲 a sleeping giant. They?셱e focused on building out there infrastructure and fabs. They?셶e admitted it?셲 going to be painful for a little while. I don?셳 care about all the haters dismissing them and saying ?쐔hey?셱e a boomer stock.??$INTC  People are shitting on intel for the $7B loss they just announced. I don?Â� think people know how investing works. If you want to build multibillion fabs and R&D it?  NVIDIA will join the trillion dollar club at some point in the next decade or so . Hold, buy on major dips, and just DRIP and forget. I still have high conviction? I?셫 LONG on Intel. I know their CEO is somewhat controversial but he?셲 an engineer at heart and is a huge improvement over the intel CEO?셲 prior. Intel lagged for 15 years but I think with their fab development and entrance into the GPU market they are at the beginning of what could be an excellent turn around IF everything goes according to plan INTC's main problems are their scuffed fundamentals ,aging( and sometimes subpar) products and excessive competition from other industry giants. INTC has to have a perfect storm with China AND spectacular turnaround story of their business. I wouldnt short INTC, but until they can generate consecutive growing cash flow, I'm just gonna hold my NVDA and stick with the industry's leader. Intel is piece of shit, its a 10 year play. Those bastards get cash iv all the time and they are still fcking anemic Dude they just disclosed that they lost 7 billion in operations cost and shares are down heavily. It?셲 not coming back up for quite sometime. No problemo! Uncle JOE just gave em' 8.7 BILLION from the CHIPS Act. (Technically YOU just gave em'..) It?셲 their foundry business that they are now separating from the design business. They did not disclose anything today that wasn?셳 known. They made a profit of 5 billion USD in total last year with their foundry business alone losing 7 billion USD. You do the math on potential value of their fabless chip design business. What they are doing today is ultimately unlocking shareholder value. They are telling regards how big they actually are. FYI their market cap as a whole is 185 billion USD. Now compare that to AMD. And btw, AMD which has had an incredible AI run up over the last year does not even release results of MLPerf benchmark. Their M100 (or whatever it?셲 named) is all hype without open verified results. Intel on the other hand are the only alternative. (Hardware and Software ecosystem)  Intel made chips in the fab long before TSMC had a clue . Their process prowess and innovation is second to none . As for anything else, remember Intel's attempt at getting into mobile? Intel's cash cow is the datacenter. ?뮣. They are losing ground there, quickly. This foundry business better take off, or Intel is gonna be in trouble in a few years, if not sooner. It'll be more about execution around turning to that type of business model. Even then, the workforce in the US will be a problem- Taiwan is absolutely a better place to have big fabs for that (and several other) reasons. It's a young person's game for sure, tough work, 24/7/365. I'll always be a fanboy but find it hard to keep any money there. INTC is good for selling doomed options I'll give you that I guess. 7.4-magnitude quake strikes off Taiwan?셲 east coast, TSMC evacuated 7.4 earthquake strikes Taiwan, TSMC evacuated per Bloomberg We will have see if this has a lasting impact on chip production. Buildings have collapsed on the island. Of course, wishing all those affected a swift and safe recovery. Just wanted to share the news here as this could have implications for AI development. Update: quake revised from 7.4 to 7.7 Update from TSMC A spokesperson from TSMC, the country?셲 computer chip maker, says that some staff are returning to their workplaces after this morning?셲 earthquake: TSMC?셲 safety systems are operating normally. Preventive measures were initiated according to procedure and some fabs were evacuated. All personnel are safe, and those evacuated are beginning to return to their workplaces. The company is currently confirming the details of the impact. Initial inspections show that construction sites are normal. However, the Company has decided to suspend work at construction sites for today, and work will resume following further inspections. Guardian reporter Gregor Hunter in Taipei it seems like the quake had an epicenter near hualien and tsmc has their fabs near hsinchu which is on the other side of the country. Im not sure how sensitive the tech would be to an earthquake but I imagine it might be fine since it wasnt near the epicenter ? then again maybe this will lead to a supply chain disruption. Taiwan gets tons of earthquakes. Big ones are rarer, but there is no doubt that TSMC designed their fabs correctly. Damn. And I thought that I was having a shitty day??My condolences to anyone affected by this. ?솋 Sending positive prayers and wishes to all those that are inconvenienced in any way. Hsinchu got shook pretty good, too. I live just north of them in Taoyuan and locals here said it was the biggest quake they've ever felt in the North of the island. Even the 1999 Jiji earthquake was felt less intensely in Taoyuan. How are the buildings built in Taiwan? Are they able to withstand big earthquakes like the ones in Japan? Here, ignorance, corruption and overlooking of building code has us all praying for no big quakes. A single quake over 7.5 is going to collapse more than half the buildings in my city. Earthquake mostly showed how well Taiwan is prepared. Sure a few buildings here and there are damaged, but nothing too serious. In a different country a 7,2 could mean thousands of deaths. I've lived through a 6.8 magnitude earthquake before, man I can't bare to imagine how they must be suffering. Factories can be rebuilt  prayers to those effected ?솋 Apple supplier TSMC evacuates as earthquake hits Taiwan Dodged the chip-okalypse! ?쏛pple supplier??is understating TSMC a tiny bit Apple is TSMC's biggest client and partner. And in turn TSMC is probably Apple's largest and most important vendor. Saying Apple supplier isn't an understatement, it's easy shorthand for general readers on their importance. I feel like even if the smallest earthquake hits those sensitive chip making machines, it?셲 going to send the hardware development back a few years. I wonder if the factories were built earthquake proof They are. They?셶e sensors to stop production in earthquakes. They were protecting the people by evacuating, abundance of caution. It?셲 on the opposite side of the country. I worked at Intels fab in Arizona and we'd have machines shutdown for imperceptible earthquakes in Nevada and California. I would get this weird nausea from some of the larger ones that most still didnt notice, and it meant an easy day because our machines were gonna receive less inventory. I beleive its the photo-lithography machines that stop which makes a ton of sense The way it is reported sounds like a big r/firstworldproblems. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE THINK ABOUT THE CHIPS? It sounds like a firstworldproblem because the headline lists them as an ?쏛pple supplier?? In reality, TSMC is the largest semiconductor manufacturing company in the world and it?셲 not even close. Given how utterly ubiquitous semiconductors are, it would absolutely be a thirdworldproblem too. And as far as Taiwan is concerned, TSMC?셲 importance is one of the main reasons China doesn?셳 just rush into Taiwan. TSMC doesn?셳 just supply Apples chips Earthquake: kills people and destroys homes of many Appleinsider: TSMC chips The fuck is the point of this comment? That there can be no discussions of industrial or infrastructural effects from natural disasters that happened to be fatal? Were you leaving similarly sarcastic comments in 2020 on any thread that discussed the industrial effects of Covid? Just seems like an unnecessary and forced attempt at taking a moral high ground when no one was being immoral. Literally the first two lines of the linked article: A 7.2 magnitude earthquake has hit Taiwan, killing 9, and causing Apple processor manufacturer to temporarily halt production. While Taiwan has had earthquakes before, this one at 8 A.M. local time on April 3, 2024, is the largest in 25 years. As well as the people killed, approximately 50 more are missing, and over 800 have been injured, according to Reuters. Expect chip prices to go brrrr TSMC is the world?셲 supplier. TSMC makes chips for AMD as well. Erdbeben In Taiwan Wer shortet TSMC mit??쁾 Halte TSMC f체r stabil genug, das wegzustecken. Fabriken werden idR auch nicht in die H철he gebaut. Laut Heise sollen zwei Fabriken ernshaft besch채digt worden sein. Die Quelle ist aber anonym. Das erdbeben wurde schon eingepreist Was meinst du damit Feeling strong today For the time being what do you have in your mouth    Youre out of your mind Its up to them to buy  Where are you going to talk about buying High point Lets go Hope everyone is OK They've already resumed production hours ago Reminds of that news story in Cyberpunk where the trapped miners were rescued and immediately sent back to work. Yup. Luckily most fabs and other people?셲 fabs in Taiwan aren?셳 near the epicentre. Plus they are used to this - they know how to build and sustain buildings way better these days than we used to. Great! Now I have more time before I need to upgrade. You've only got a few more hours, the earthquake didn't buy you much time At some point they're going to have to supercool CPU packages or use some other material to achieve superconductivity, or it won't matter how many transistors are in a CPU. Whatever happened to LK-99? LK-99? Last I heard, not superconductive, just highly conductive and in specific arrangements of the material. (Don't quote me.) So, superconductors at room temperature continue to elude material scientists. :/ From wikipedia By mid-August 2023, the consensus was that LK-99 is not a superconductor at any temperature Damn my FPS Thanks a lot God Similar thing happened to dac chips when the AKG factory burnt down... Mostly, they are afraid of Communist China invasion, so they use an earthquake as excuse Is this a bit? China: Invades, no no mo, not Invasion. We are delivering humanitarian aid with our cannons and rockets, stop resisting our aid!! This is why we desperately need to get some high-end chip production to Europe or the US. Anything happens to Taiwan - I hope ya'll got your old GPUs stored well, just in case. You know TSMC is currently building a 40 billion dollar facility in Arizona? Considering the PRC might start a full naval blockade of the island at any minute, they'd have to be pretty stupid to not move some lines, machinery, stockpiles and blueprints somewhere safer and rig all their units to implode or sabotage them in case of invasion. I wouldn't be surprised if Taiwan and/or the US has some kind of scorched earth policy and destroy the facilities themselves if the PRC ever invades Didn?셳 they build a new factory in Arizona? IMT Expected benefit from Micron IMT Micron expected to benefitBofA Securities has released an analytical report on Micron
The content is that the BofA Micron HBM market share is expected to rise from the current 5 level to 25 in 2027 and the annual growth rate of HBM will reach 50 every year As a result Microns price target is raised to 120 144 making the stock skyrocketThe annual growth rate of HBM approaches 50 every year and the market share of Micron HBM increases by 5 times to 25To do this it is calculated that Micron will increase its current HBM production capacity by 25 times This means that you can get 25 times more IMTs HBM CO2 cleaner by simple calculation INTC Market is overreacting to foundry losses. $7B is more than analysts were thinking (allegedly), but is more likely than not an accounting play to get tax benefits. That being said, selling not done, yet, though. I'd buy if when dips below $40. I?셫 buying long on intc. We need US manufacturers. Micron and intc will eventually be our players. For now they?셱e playing catch up. Very patriotic. :) But more importantly it will make you money. Good entry point for sure. i think it is going to gone down again for the rest of the week maybe buy puts until the end of the week and then buy 40$ calls for next week ? I personnaly would love to buy INTC calls under 40$, i think there is money to be made .... I have the puts right now might get calls for over the weekend. The bottom hasn't been found yet. None of their news is going to be reflective immediately. It's a long play. Their financials haven't been great, and I expect this quarter to be rough. It's wait more till mid 30s before paying ball long term Holding intel calls long also Intel to 60 by June? Hard to say it can bounce that much. I am expecting market to rally into this earnings season, but it may top out at 52-53. If you sell now Every market price depends on it
Cheer up until the end and roll it up to make a beekeeping In the Korean semiconductor market tomorrow I organized it at Samjeons closing priceThats a relief Whew Intel discloses $7 billion operating loss for chip-making unit https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-discloses-financials-foundry-business-2024-04-02/ Intel said the manufacturing unit had $7 billion in operating losses for 2023, a steeper loss than the $5.2 billion in operating losses the year before. The unit had revenue of $18.9 billion for 2023, down 31% from $63.05 billion the year before. During a presentation for investors, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said that 2024 would be the year of worst operating losses for the company's chipmaking business and that it expects to break even on an operating basis by about 2027. Gelsinger said the foundry business was weighed down by bad decisions, including one years ago against using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines from Dutch firm ASML (ASML.AS), opens new tab. While those machines can cost more than $150 million, they are more cost-effective than earlier chip making tools. Intel told investors it would start reporting the results of its manufacturing operations as a standalone unit. The company has been investing heavily to catch up to its primary chipmaking rivals, TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co Article TLDR: Pre-EUV = bad / Post-EUV = good but late Problem is that they have BIG BAD and the GOOD needs to work hard to cover that big BAD. It is going to take a while (2027+) I own this stock, and for some reason.. I get GE-vibes with Intel, in terms of stock movement and company management. It is going to take a while (2027+) This is the whole issue with Intel for me. Like I could invest now, or I could invest in 3 years when the price is probably the same lol. I hate owning this stock. Why don?셳 you sell then? $19b is not 31% down from $63b. Thank you! The article was probably written by an LLM, although even these systems know basic math. Management problem. hits head against wall These numbers will obviously affect public perception and stock price in the short term, but long term it?셲 the right move. Ability to rely on Taiwan and TSMC is waning. Im (very) long on Intel, If they?셱e able to pull their plan off they will be a very formidable force in the American and EU markets. Why waning? Two foundries being built in Arizona and one in Japan. I?셫 honestly curious.  They say to buy when others are fearful. Judging from the overall sentiment in the comments, this means that we are nearing an excellent time to begin loading up our bags. Pls proceed Or maybe sentiment is bad for good reason? Anything new here? INTC willingly ceded industry leadership because they wanted to do more buybacks and milk older technology. If they?셱e doing something about it, great. If not, INTC has been a turd for years, nothings changed. Personally I like to think this is the time to go long INTC. Jesus Christ lol, yet the r/stocks community here will continue to downvote you if you dare say one bad thing about this crap company. Glad I got out years ago rather than being blinded by delusion and false promises.  I also want to add that they boosted their net income recently by jacking up the value of their chip making machines and reducing the depreciation cost on them . This boosted the company's net income and now they come out and say these were crap and we need to buy more capable chip makers . I don?셳 know why people are that shocked by this. Yes the announcement sort of came out of the blue but just because they are getting ASML machines soon doesn?셳 just mean they will be profitable overnight like some people for some strange reason thought. I kept seeing a lot of ridiculously bullish posts on Intel in the last 1.5 months on this sub and many others. All of them ignored the main issue being that is a long term play not even close to short term play. The other issue is I just genuinely don?셳 know how you can hold Intel right now. Not for nothing but other than Mobileye there?셲 not really any reason to not invest elsewhere. ??Intel in a massive AI and Datacenter boom has either consistently lost revenue & marketshare every quarter or stayed close to flat whilst lowering margins into the ground ??Datacenter/AI chips are supposed to be high margin high profit chips. If your margins are at 2% they you practically are giving them away at cost to try to keep hold of any marketshare you have ??GPU wise gaining any marketshare will take time. The issue is their gen 2 GPU?셲 (Battlemage) can?셳 have a flop like their gen 1 (Alchemist). Admittedly this area definitely requires a lot of trial and error so Alchemist having a real rocky start is to be expected. ??Intel gaining any headway with other companies that want them to make their chips is going to be tough. Being a distant 3rd or 4th place choice means either taking massive discounts on chip deals or somehow beating the snot out of TSMC and Samsung which is not something I see. ??Intel has had a lot of its good faith thrown out the window. A lot of companies left Intel foundries for other fabs. Intel screwing up so much in recent years probably doesn?셳 inspire confidence. ??Client Computing Group is the only place where Intel is still king but it?셲 also one of the more volatile sectors. A 2-3% shift here whether it be market factors or competition could fuck them pretty severely. ??Not for nothing but everyone saying stuff about chip availability needs to realize that both Samsung and TSMC are building massive plants in the US and other parts of the world too. This thing ain?셳 catching up to tsm fyi It went up a lot Its heavy and difficult but awesome Jeolla Province Jeolla Province Lets go Cheer up Cold radish Pre-Market Movers ?벐?뱤 - 4/3/24 Intel Corporation (INTC): Down 4.7% due to increasing operating loss in semiconductor business. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): Down 1.3% as Guggenheim and Deutsche Bank cut price targets post weak delivery numbers. Paramount Global (PARA): Up 3.2% on potential exclusive sale talks with Skydance. Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY): Up 6.6% after 100M share repurchase, despite weaker earnings. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.

I?셫 long TSLA Samsung It slowed down today but like Micron Samsung Electronics has a possibility of rising 56 Scared It could be a historic high TSMC Earthquake DD Like most of you guys I was initially worried about the earthquake and. TSMC. HOWEVER.... I remembered that Taiwan is on the ""Ring of Fire"" AKA where all the tectonic plates hit each other a ton creating volcanoes and ELEVATED EARTHQUAKE RISK. **QUESTIONS TO ASK** 1) Why would TSMC not consider ""Ring of Fire"" in their own contingency/safety plans? 2) Why would Nvidia and AMD lawyers not put in clauses requiring elevated safety standards and precautions to offset risk? Article 1: TSMC Case Study - Earthquakes Article 2: Shock Absorbers Help Taiwan Chip Plants Avoid Quake Damage Key Points from Article 1: Following the September 21, 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, TSMC has laid down a series of earthquake protection management plans surpassing legal requirements. The company has conducted a comprehensive investigation on all buildings and facilities, set up dampers to improve building structures, and adopted new anti-seismic technologies and methodologies to assess and control the risks.  TSMC's strategy is to simultaneously enhance the seismic resistance of facilities along with emergency response skills . On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung . It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park . |2000| The seismic coefficient was improved beyond legal requirements by as much as 25% for main structure of new buildings, 50% for nonstructural components. New seismic anchorage was installed onto equipment and facilities. |2008| The greatest potential earthquake hazard analysis of each site, evaluation of anti-seismic ability of hardware facilities. Dampers were installed along with new Fab; seismic response was reduced by 15 - 20%. |2012| Floating piles were installed in new Fabs of Tainan Science Park, which decreased seismic amplitude by 25% in the Fabs. Evaluation of raised floor shaking table test and improvement of process tool anchorage. |2013 Installation of seismic isolation platform onto furnace tool. |2015| Establishment of Earthquake Early Warning System. |2016| Additional stoppers were installed for tower stocker to prevent sliding and ceiling bracings added to strengthen ceiling. The guiding principles of TSMC earthquake management policy are ""Zero casualty, short operation recovery time and least impact on customers"". Cross-Fabs post-earthquake emergency response procedures and business continuity plans were established according to these guiding principles. Constantly and systematically, TSMC minimizes damage caused by earthquakes and enhances anti-seismic ability. Article 2: ?쏧n terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,??the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage. In regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues. ?쏱anel makers are reducing production in succession. Global average utilization rare in 3Q22 is expected to be revised to 65%,??it said. Innolux, based in Tainan, had also started reducing producing on a large scale last September. It is worth noting that Taiwan?셲 importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia?셲 dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the self-ruled island?셲 biggest company, has a more than half of the global foundry market, while other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market. One of the reasons for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi?셲 visit to the island last month was allegedly to convince TSMC to set up a manufacturing base in the United States. It?셲 big money ??the global semiconductor market was worth more than $520 billion in 2021. And with chips used in so many products these days, the sector?셲 importance has risen dramatically. People in Taiwan are probably saying a quiet prayer of thanks that the weekend?셲 quakes were not a lot worse Join WSB Discord Seems normal to me. Shutdown on lines and paying third party inspectors and vendors will cost $$ in revenue but i?셫 confident no significant delays will happen TSMC just showed that they can handle a very strong earthquake (strongest in 25 years) safely and well, nothing seems very broken, nothing collapsed, no catastrophic failures. Estimated $60MM impact, which is peanuts. So, TSMC is robust even against strong earthquakes, that is a good thing. Bro did more DD on an earthquake than most do when yoloing their life savings ?ァ Brother did earthquake DD People are forgetting that its their strongest earthquake in 25 yrs which means they have another 25 yrs to pump out more product Pelosi visited the island last month to convince them to build American fabs that have been in the works for years?  Either way. The only thing stopping this company is a black swan event, an invasion or a sumatran mega volcano. I?셫 more confident in the earth and the volcano actually being successful.  Edit: the volcano eruption causing the havoc around 536, likely in Sumatra, leaving the world in around 18-24 months of volcanic winter. I have to guess if that happens today, the fab is fucked before the famine hits. Earth quakes have been priced in already. This is actually good DD. Buy the dip tomorrow. I don't know man go to r/taiwan This is great DD! I'm not worried about the earthquake more so that now china has a perfect catalyst to invade. TSMC Evacuates Production Lines After Major Taiwan Quake That's terrible for everyone affected. 7.5 is a massive earthquake. For reference, the LA earthquake in 94 was a 6.7 and resulted in 9,000 injuries and 70 deaths. And there was no tsunami. I lived about 50 miles away at the time as a kid and it threw me out of my bed. Earthquakes are no joke and I hope the best for everyone. Also since this is r/hardware... I know this gets talked about more often now but this is another in a long line of reasons why so much of the world's silicon manufacturing should not be relying on a single island off the coast of China. The silver lining mitigating factor, at least, is that the earthquake hit on the east side of the island. Which is not nearly as densely populated as other parts. The bulk of Taiwan's population (and industry) are on the north (Taipei) and west sides, as the east is rather mountainous until you're very near the coast. Looking at some empirical data, the USGS's shakemap estimate for the earthquake puts Taipei in a mix of Intensity V/VI areas. Which is strong shaking, but is normally only ""very-light"" to ""light"" damage (USGS definition), especially in a country prepared for an earthquake. Still, this is going to be billions and billions (and billions) of dollars in damages for Taiwan, especially in the cities near the epicenter. Even if you're prepared for this, it's a life-changing event all around. My condolences to those who have been affected.?삜 (For reference, this is the strongest quake to hit Taiwan in 25 years. All of their big ones tend to strike along the east coast due to the plate tectonics involved. So this is right where the Taiwanese government would be expecting such a quake to hit) The Tsunami warning has been cancelled (as per radio announcement) so looks like they at least avoided that. How are production lines and machine protected from something like this? Doesn't this ruin, or at least completely throw of the calibration from every machine in the place? Are ASML machines engineered to sustain a certain amount? Or is it the facility itself? Apparently ASML has some ability to detect quakes, but then what? I'd like to see Ian Cutress, or Asianometry make a video about this. Safe to assume every wafer that was being worked on during the quake is ruined. I'd like to see Ian Cutress, or Asianometry make a video about this. You're in luck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNKF21B01NQ They had similar earthquakes back in 2022 and TSMC bounced back pretty quickly. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Taitung_earthquakes Is there any oficial statement from TSMC spokesperson ? There is some info that pipelines are affected , cracked walls and wafers in the current production affected. Also supply chain is not going to be an issue in this case or power outrages ? sadly we all know whats gonna happen on chip prices later Taiwanese firms from TSMC to ASE Technology Holding Co. make the vast majority of the semiconductors that go into devices from iPhones to cars from factories vulnerable to even the slightest tremors. A single vibration can destroy entire batches of the precision-made semiconductors. Is TSMC screwed? No. TSMC Evacuation: Tsunami Warning Issued for Taiwan, Japan's Okinawa After Earthquake I wonder how markets will react to this tmrw? ""Southern Taiwan Science Park, where semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co has a plant, said companies were operating without impact."" Fabs are built with earthquake bracing. These things don?셳 cost billions to make for nothing tsmc official response : https://imgur.com/a/hdctxIt  Taiwan in the morning (3) earthquake, industrial safety system normal, to ensure the safety of personnel, according to the company's internal procedures . Construction work will be suspended at various sites in Taiwan today . Says TSMC evacuated some production lines. Also says production won't be majorly impacted, but when they're selling everything they make, that isn't great. That could hit a lot of bottom lines if they miss quotas. Not a good day for chipmakers https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-discloses-financials-foundry-business-201110276.html Still, I think TSMC will bounce back more easily than Intel. I hope everyone's safe over there. Pretty sure intel's operating loss has nothing to do with the earthquake - this article was published before the earthquake Intel is down more than 4% after hours, while the rest of the semis seem unaffected. With respect to Taiwan, perhaps footage is limited, but all the news reports seem to show the same two buildings partially collapsed. With any luck, that?셲 the extent of the major damage? Bounce back? Unless TSMC is lying they?셱e not impacted, comparing TSM to INTC right now is like comparing chocolate with shit, sure they?셱e both brown and look kinda doughy but that?셲 about it. Probably will cause a dip in TSMC at least while information is spotty, but not likely to be major for others unless information comes out that production halt duration is substantial (> week) TSMC newest response : https://imgur.com/ExTH6ye  TSMC has resources in place to accelerate full recovery and is continuing to resume work today . All extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment is intact .  Most or at least a lot of batches of chips under production, specifically photolithography and etching are likely to be wiped out .

My life saviongs in there bought at 175. what to do? I bought a handful of shares for $60 a pop years ago, the current state of affairs is too volatile for me, I sold and transferred back to my checking. Taking my profits and running! numerous aftershocks predicted and who knows maybe an earthquake storm. perfecting timing with todays drop think people will heavily derisk tomorrow Ha, hilarious. u/brad4711 will get a kick out of this one... here's another ancient account (5 years) that all of a sudden had to post on r/AMD_Stock. TSMC soon to the moon 20% oh I remember the optimize last month....bought calls Steamrolled into monthly earnings. Crushed it! Thought--I'll close these out before the end of the day and take all this profit and position for quarterly earnings...an hour later it all imploded and has bled out 1-2% a day ever since Right there with you man....that 03/08 on TSMC rug pull was rough We ride at dawn Not a prediction, but $150 could be in the stars if numbers and guidance are solid. Got a small small position on TSM but thinking about going in deeper. I have $197 as my next target in the big picture. At least expecting a 20% upside, earnings in couple of days. I think earnings are April 18. Earthquake effect? Such a bad timing, anyways will try to add few more tomorrow TSMC: One Trillion Transistor GPUs Will Be Possible in a Decade Cerebras Systems Unveils World?셲 Fastest AI Chip with Whopping 4 Trillion Transistors Define ?쏥PU?? H100 has 80 billion transistors MI300 has 153 billion transistors B100 has 208 billion transistors Scaling is going to happen, if it?셲 at the chiplet/die, package, wafer, node, rack, cluster or datacenter level. As for 3D stacking, for logic heat is going to be a major bottleneck. I would imagine that they may mean large chiplets on interposers and similar advanced packaging to minimize the latency between dies. It seems that 3D stacking is mainly for stacked RAM, either in the form of SRAM like the 3D Cache currently featured on AMD CPUs or in the form of DRAM like on HBM. Yet another possibility is full wafer sized chips like the WSE. Perhaps a better question may be the density of future generations of chips compared to today and the costs per transistor. That's especially true as node scaling slows more and in the case of cache, has stopped. But whats a single GPU at that point? And why doesnt WSE count? The reticle limit is 104 B on 4 NP. That will be an interesting time because of the cost per wafer. Also if you go with Intel's claims they'll be using glass substrates by then which have some claimed benefits over current and past materials. Unless wafer prices stagnate in the next decade I see companies passing on the bill to consumers. Products across the line will get more expensive to offset manufacturing costs. I see companies passing on the bill to consumers RTX 7060 will cost 2 grand I want to know how to cool a GPU with like 3 to 10 layers or even more.  Even if the fluid formula is right, there is no corrosion like on AIOs, if I inject fluid through silicon wafers I will eventually, after years and years, cause extra wear and tear through erosion . What other options are there being studies for thermal transfer through multiple layers? Or is this the only candidate? Just cool helium-4 to -271째C so that it becomes a superfluid and flows without any viscosity Graphene-carbon nanotubes. Additionally, the immersion of the G-CNT in water enables an additional heat dissipation path via the solid?뱇iquid interaction, allowing for the sustainable cooling of the hot surface under a constant power input of up to 10 000 W cm??. So maybe we won't get graphene transistors, at least not yet, but we may be able to use it to draw heat away from these layered GPUs. I can see them making the data centers with huge cooling loops, like nuclear reactors use, even having the cooling towers everyone mistakes for the reactor itself, and in the desert they may route some of the piping below the center in order to provide stable temperatures at night. Deserts can have really big temperature swings from night to day. Thirdrate loser Im blessed to be in the US To death Shes writing comments here",8

Cheating again Bubble INTC - buy and don't look back (for next few months) I've had my eye on INTC hitting $40 to start building a position, and while we're not quite there yet, the risk/reward seems skewed to the upside from current levels. Could INTC dip a bit further? Maybe. But the downside seems limited, while $48 by summer-end feels very achievable as a first upside target. If it can reclaim and hold above $48, I'll double down on my position. Anything less and I'll probably cut and run. The negative foundry narrative is obscuring the underlying progress. Buy from here.

They did not report anything that wasn?셳 already in their 2023 earnings report. All they did was break out the two businesses. Fabless vs Fabs. Not to mention, Wallstreet was expecting a 6B loss. While 1 billion dollors is a big deal, a 17% overrun is not nearly as big a deal as today's price action would suggest. I highly doubt INTC sustains this selloff for long.

TSMC/Apple: Major Earthquake in Taiwan Halts Some Apple Chip Production Lines  TSMC's N3 fab in Tainan suffered structural damage, with beams and columns broken . EUV machines, essential for manufacturing processes below 7nm, have stopped . Research and development labs have been subject to significant damage, such as cracked walls . https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/major-earthquake-in-taiwan/ The TSMC fabs are build on dampeners for exactly this reason, their engineers aren?셳 idiots. Production might get halted but the fab will be fine. They are a low cost producer.  Engineering isn't everything, most times MBA drive the ship. Cracks in walls and breach of vacuum can mean months-long delays in an ultra-clean room that has to remain dust-free for nm-level processes. Who cares? Very short term issue I bet TSMC cares. And I bet companies seeking some of TSMCs production capacity care. Apple uses the most advanced process nodes. To be economical (for tsmc) you need to run those expensive machine non stop. Capacity is also constrained. They are using 100% of it. So delays inevitably mean someone is screwed even if it isn?셳 Apple. Also, the damage didn?셳 sound slight. Sounded significant. ?ㄸ THINKING.. this situation will cause our government to green light chip manufacturing in the USA,, they will dump stupid money into it now, ,, construction firms will up pay, offer bonuses, ,, salary offers will go up more then before for technical people, venders have opportunities to make a fortune,, anyone connected to the building of the new chip plants, from the food truck person to the engineers will do very well for years to come Who gonna make chips to compete with them? Intel is gonna be operating at at a loss for quite some time. It?셲 crazy how fragile this all is If you think TSMC is fragile, take a look at Taiwan as a whole...TSMC is basically their main barrier against being invaded, as the entire world would be crippled when TSMC shuts down during an invasion.

radish If you want to buy in the Korean market Hey kid Do you want to be criticized that much Is NVDA and AMZN Overvalued Hey guys I sure this question gets asked a lot by many others but wanted to hear some new opinions Currently I working on a model using Excel to capture the intrinsic value of all companies To do this I run under the assumption that most of the large companies are currently more or less fairly valued This is how I test to see whether my model is working as intended Based on this assumption I was able to create a formula that pretty much captures the analyst agreedupon value of most of the large companies but currently I have Nvidia at around 440 and Amazon at around 75 These assumptions are based on their historical CAGR of cash flows at around 37 and 10 respectively Now i know historical growth is not necessarily indicative of future growth but based on my model Nvidia would have to grow by about 66 YOY and Amazon about 35 Just want to hear other opinions on whether these growth figures seem fairly accurate or if that being too generous to these companies that may have already eaked or am I just wildly off on my assumptions If we assume that these growth figures are to be expected how do you go about updating the growth rate when performing your DCF Analysis Thanks AMZN is not overvalued its hard to measure their value since a lot of their free cashflow is used for RD How much of it is required to maintain amazon conpetitive position though Even jeff wrote in his shareholder letters than fcf was the single best method for valuing amazon I still think amazon is the future One of the reasons I dont invest in these companies is that I cant even make a ball park estimate of whether those are right Take NVDA How much is their market about AI How much of that market depends on some shaky AI businesses that are blowing through VC capital right now and are going to go to the wall in 12 months if some sucker doesnt buy them Whats the extra value of any useful AI in the next 3 years How much of their market is the large clouds and what is the effect of Microsoft Google etc making their own custom chips to do the workload If I worked at Amazon Web Services or if I was building things with Hugging Face I might have some sort of grip on it but I dont so I dont know I dont have any sort of basic data that can help me make that prediction And that pricing leaves little room for an eh its so cheap even if it barely grows Ill do OK investment NVDA only grows 20 for 3 years that price is going to crash Imagine if Elon Musk spent all his time and capital solely on building rockets No Twitter no Tesla just all the knowledge and stupid enough to try attitude focused solely on rockets Thats what you got with Jensen Huang I cant even begin to tell you how amazing all his choices for the last twenty years have been how far out he can look into the future and prepare for it NVDA is Jensen Huang On your point 2 I dont think you really understand what is going on right now In order to understand this AI thing it helps if you understand why it is so unique and revolutionary The tech boom of the early 2000s was the ability to share information at 0 marginal cost The Generative AI boom of the early 2020s is the ability to generate information at 0 marginal cost What we are essentially doing with AI is creating artificial brain power that can do knowledge tasks If youre judging generative AI by Chat GPT as amazing as it is wont be taking anybodys job Chat GPT is just proof of concept though Why the biggest customers of NVDA need and will continue to need NVDA in the future is ability to build ever more complex and powerful networks With more processing powers comes the ability to generate more sophisticated information from entire movies complete with visuals acting and special effects to schematics for hydrogen fusion reactors and chemical compounds we humans havent thought of yet These companies MUST build these networks or risk competing against companies that have them It is the manifestation of the proverbial If an infinite amount of monkeys were in a room with an infinite amount of typewriters would they produce the completed works of Shakespeare Soon we will have an infinite amount of Einsteins solving physics problems Einsteins that wont worry about morals vacation divorce medical problems or anything else that would hold back a human There will be no doubt some garbage SPAC companies purpose made to bilk investors But Generative AI is real transformative and revolutionary and

und Fairness  Transparenz und Unabhngigkeit  Frderung von Kultur und Bildung  Brgerbeteiligung  beitragsfinanziert WO SEHEN WIR GEGENWRTIG PROBLEME Seit geraumer Zeit verzeichnen wir eine Eingrenzung des Debattenraums anstelle einer Erweiterung der Perspektive Wir vermissen den Fokus auf unsere Kernaufgabe Brgern multiperspektivische Informationen anzubieten Stattdessen verschwimmen Meinungsmache und Berichterstattung zusehends auf eine Art und Weise die den Prinzipien eines serisen Journalismus widerspricht Nur sehr selten finden relevante inhaltliche Auseinandersetzungen mit kontrren Meinungen statt Stimmen die einen medial behaupteten gesellschaftlichen Konsens hinterfragen werden wahlweise ignoriert lcherlich gemacht oder gar ausgegrenzt Inflationr bedient man sich zu diesem Zwecke verschiedener ampfbegriffewie uerdenker chwurbler limaLeugner utinVersteher esinnungspazifistund anderen mit denen versucht wird Minderheiten mit abweichender Meinung zu diffamieren und mundtot zu machen Das sorgfltige berprfen zweifelhafter Meldungen ist wichtig Allerdings suggerieren sogenannte Faktenchecks oft durch ihre Machart berschrift und Formulierungen eine vermeintlich absolute Wahrheit die selten existiert Der freie gesellschaftliche Diskurs wird dadurch schmerzhaft beschnitten Innere und uere Bedingungen fhren dazu dass Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter des ffentlichrechtlichen Rundfunks ihren journalistischethischen Standards nicht mehr gengen knnen Dazu zhlen innerbetriebliche Praktiken wie die schon vor Dreh bzw ReportageBeginn feststehende Kernaussage von Beitrgen die Zentralisierung der Berichterstattung ber sogenannte Newsrooms oder Newsdesks zu groer Zeitdruck bei der Recherche eine berwiegend an Einschaltquoten orientierte Programmgestaltung Sparmanahmen der Sender am Programm und nicht zuletzt die Tatsache dass zwei Drittel des redaktionellen Personals nur Zeitvertrge haben oder gar komplett ohne Angestelltenverhltnis als sogenannte Freie arbeiten mssen Letzteres fhrt zu Existenzngsten die wiederum entsprechend ngepasstenJournalismus begnstigen Aufgrund der hohen personellen Fluktuation bleibt zudem oft keine Zeit fr fachlichen Wissenstransfer Also stellen die endlich wieder Moderatoren ein die bullshitantworten als solche entlarven statt einfach nur ne Bhne fr irgendwelche komischen Thesen zu bieten Das breite Meinungsspektrum bringt das Problem des False Balancing mit sich Wir brauchen keine Beitrge von Klimawandelleugnern da die Debatte schon weiter fortgeschritten ist und die Leugnung des menschengemachten Klimawandels eine faktenfreie Minderheitsposition ist Fr einen konstruktiven Diskurs geht es also nur noch um die Lsung des Problems und nicht mehr um die Existenz des Problems selbst Und da sind wir beim zweiten Problem des breiten Meinungsspektrums Wie umgehen mit Problemlsungen die gegen unsere Gesetze verstoen Diese sind ja in manchen Bereichen schon recht breit vertreten Eigentlich drfen solche Positionen auch keinen Platz bekommen Und damit hat man dann ein gar nicht mehr so breites Meinungsspektrum Das sollte aber dafr umso differenzierter bercksichtigt werden Wieso gehst du davon aus dass breites Meinungsspektrum Klimawandelleugner bedeutet Die Gruppe ist sowieso sehr klein das ist im Moment leider nicht das dominierende Thema im gesellschaftlichen Diskurs und es ist gefhrlich breites Meinungsspektrum direkt mit Schwurblertum gleichzusetzen Vermeintliche Wahrheiten mssen immer wieder berprft werden  auch wenn Du meinst die Wahrheit gepachtet zu haben Finde ich gut Wird aber besonders ARD und ZDF nicht interessieren dazu gibt es viel zu viele dubiose Strukturen und Nutznieer Was ist das fr n dmliches unter Tolle Wirtschaftsthemen habt ihr hier D Ist hier mehr so ein Kulturkampfding berlegen fhlen und ein Thema zum Hetzen haben sind hier Zulassungsvoraussetzung Sonst kannst du weitergehen Ich will keine weite meinungsfreiheit ich will die wissenschaftlichen harten fakten Mir ist egal was ein Klimawandel Leugner oder Auto Lobbyist sagt Wir mssen klar gemacht bekommen es gibt bei vielen sachen keine meinung zu haben Da gibt es richtig und falsch Klimawandel und Diktatoren kmmern sich einen scheidreck um deine Meinung Macht macht recht es war schon immer so und wenn wir den idioten und querdenkern teile der macht der Medien geben werden sie von vielen als richtig angesehen Gott ich hoffe das der Dritte Weltkrieg bald beginnt die dummheit der menschen muss ausgebrannt werden Was fr eine Geisteshaltung Mir egal was andere fr ne Meinung haben schlielich hab ich ja die Wahrheit gepachtet Leider ist genau das der Grund warum unsere Gesellschaft auseinanderdriftet und Dialog und Konsens keine Chance mehr haben Wer jeden als Nazi diffamiert weil er in irgendeinem Punkt ne andere Meinung vertritt ist halt leider nicht ganz sauber Fordert mal lieber eine Reform des Rundfunkmodells Gefhlt alle paar Jahr wird der Beitrag erhht nur weil keiner von den feinen Herren dort sparen mchte Vor allen in so einer angespannt Lage wie jetzt ist es dreist die Erhhung mit Gewalt durchzupeitschen Das trgt sich zur Akzeptanz bei Sowie Andersdenkende die die Corona Politik hinterfragt haben nicht von dem R diffamiert wurden Fragt mal bei Heike Makatsch nach  Oder sowie Andersdenkende die die Flchtlingspolitik seit 2015 hinterfragen nicht vom R diffamiert werden Fragt mal bei Boris Palmer nach  Endlich mehr Kommunismus wagen Interessant vielleicht liest das Manifest ja jemand wieso nennen eigentlich nur die grten idioten ihre wortkotze manifest Klopft sich selbst auf die Schulter Man wir machen einen so guten Job ey  So GEZ ist fllig her mit der Kohle sonst gehste in den Knast Ist ja ekelhaft Also ausschluss

Price Stability 122 I think AI has a ways to go I agree when I asked the AI for certain calculations it did make mistakes I am not great at math myself but I could tell some things were off I just had to adjust what I was asking and seemed to work overall The one im really not sure about is the results from asking what the total gross profits would be in 1 year given everything I mean it looks right but I cant say for sure if the math is mathing Hey man everyone in here is kinda toxic but I appreciate your efforts on the matter You should refine your method and see how the results compare Thanks I appreciate it I dont really understand the negativity and down votes really It was just a experiment for fun and something to just post about on my blog If the results were good or if I could modify anything to be better that would be great That was the purpose of posting it here I have been going through a lot of the posts here and thought everyone was really helpful or else I wouldnt have bothered but I guess some dont care to discuss I just started getting into Investing now Im almost 43 and want to start a safety net for the future Its never to late as they say Very interesting Which AI model did you use Interesting picks I like most but dont know some hope youre doing your own research and putting in more cash a 50 allocation to mcd isnt going to give those juicy dividends This ETF run by a robot is beating the marketeres how it works httpswwwcnbccomamp20190802thisetfrunbyarobotisbeatingthemarkethereshowitworkshtml Just mebut almost all of those names are better suited to be held in an index fund Really interesting post I think AI could be quite helpful in if nothing else helping folks learn about the market What I see as the downfall is that the market is not necessarily logical I applaud your efforts here and as someone trying to educate themselves about investing this is really cool Great post and ignore the weird negativity It is apparently a personality quirk that goes along with the types who 1 like social media and 2 invest largely in dividends  Awesome What is price stability If I understand correctly it is the fluctuations of a stock price over time  Im sure it has more of explanation but in simple terms If the  is high red it means the stock is unstable and lower  green the stock is more stable Economists use the term to refer to inflationary  deflationary httpsenwikipediaorgwikiPricestability behavior Not sure what it means in the context of these picks though We would need more info about the AI model Could have something to do with the companys pricing power and sensitivity to inflationdeflation in its economic segment but  Why would Microchip have 45 and McDonalds have 89 Or it could be what NarrowStick says and its about stock price stability but why would the model use an industry accepted term for something else instead of say alpha and beta which are standard terms for stock price performance and volatility It didn pick any real estate investments which it seems strange Did you tell it not to pick those I think it would be prudent to have the AI run a valuation model so you dont overpay for something that might be otherwise a great position Seems to be missing lots of high dividend irtystocks like MO and oil pipeline companies Also seems weighted to high rather than mid cap I did ask the AI for a list of the best diversified high growth dividend yields and this is what was given to me I assume it factored in some things im not aware about and they were compared to other stocks Just an assumption though My initial thoughts are that many of the companies chosen are relatively good companies that have currently depressed prices but unfortunately for good reasons which might be ok long term but not short term For example I sold TXN a while back because the earnings estimates for the next two years are pretty bad which will drag the price down and the dividend payout ratio up too high for good dividend increases for several years I am a duvidend growth investor so that us important to me maybe not you It looks to me like the AI is not looking close enough at future earnings estimates I think its too early to buy TXN APD is going to be heavily impacted in the next 10 years by competitors coming into the hydrogen industry to serve our carbon goals Big names like Xom and Cvx will go from customers to competitors There is going to be a huge ramp up for demand though so will the rising tide lift all boats or will competition crush margins I wish I knew Earnings estimates are still good but because they are spending capital building hydrogen plants dividend growth is slowing I continue to hold but watch earnings estimates closely Anyway my 2 cents No1 buyer of Koreans in Kium Go up while getting some adjustments Reply to deleted post Micron up 3 Theres a lot of sick trash lol lolEnvidoglko Did all the worms get bitten by the secondary battery Laughing The market I need to buy a company that does the same business at the salon
3rd place Microns stock price is the highestThe main culprit is the directorgenerals agency the pensioners Update on TSMC Position Market open vs Market closed Same for me but with SQ Block Was up 1k and now down 12k but expires in 2025 so I holding out It unfortunate but hopefully with a good jobs report tomorrow we can bounce back Good luck on your yolo I hope you do well because that would be a very good sign for NVDA AMD I have 25k lost in one day Why isnt KX Hightech going up What did you do without buying anything when you were going wild for 70 or 80Im 100 over the top",2
2024-04-05,Amazon is currently selling AMD motherboards and Intel CPUs as a bundle This has been a thing for months if not years Why though Still rated 4 stars If you need any more proof that Amazon reviews are all fake This is because of one of Amazons biggest disasters review mixing Every review is for the product variant of just Motherboard Not a single review mentions Intel So Amazon takes that same motherboard product listing and adds a motherboard  CPU combo Maybe just done by AI because the algorithm noticed people buy a motherboard and CPU together and it paired these at random And here we are You can see the listing has a bunch of other random bundles for this motherboard too which are all two random products sold together Motherboard  headphones motherboard  monitor motherboard  SSD All of them have the exact same set of reviewsratings which are for the motherboard alone Sheesh just find a bundle with an Intel Motherboard and an AMD processor and buy both s why build one pc when you can build two for double the price tomayto tomahto Amazon is such an unorganized mess I only buy something there if its the only place on the internet that has it amazon is just temu now Rebranded cheap chinese knockoff products that look like the real thing but are made of paper mache and dreams at the cheapest possible cost This is what happens when you let any joe schmoe sell on amazon I got lucky it seems and all my parts from amazon were good to go But sheesh I feel bad for the people who dont know that there are intel specific and amd specific motherboards Id be super bummed as a new pc person if i bought this only to find out that it would never work This bundle is shipped and sold by amazon Not joe shmo Edit they blocked me lol nice i713700k We look like a couple in the picture Gigabyte AMD Motherboard a couple of besties How to confuse PCMR Rookies part 234 This is epic combo Overpriced low end AM5 and overpriced underperforming i7 Its like they found crap and made it a crap bundle Amazon is such trash these days one out of every 5 orders is incorrect Inot renewing my prime when it runs out in a couple of months I doneven trust them anymore for anything expensive since fakes are very common even from Sold by Amazon Products Those bundles were probably curated by The Verge Go to the product page and report the listing I did my part Tryna decipher who is really brain dead and doesnt read things Bernstein Analysts Want You To Forget Intel INTC Until At Least 2030 Profits are in the rearviewmirror for Patty boy At least someone is realistic about the mountain INTC has to climb Not a glimpse Intc is building fabs around this planet this will get very expensive I dont see how they can continue to offer a divided Intel is another Boeing who cares more about retaining their investors than retaining customers Analysts saying what has been grossly apparent to many for like 46 years now Ya there was a reprieve thanks to the pandemic demand spike but writing has been on the wall awhile Ill be keeping an eye on intel I may even buy it at some point but only if there are signs their fabs are making a strong technological comeback I dont care if their fab unit starts turning a profit i will only be interested if they show signs of actual significant technical leadership again Either TSMC needs to drop the ball andor intel needs a dominant technical breakthrough or Im not interested Pat loves to say they have technical leadership but his words ring hollow they need to prove it and thus far they have not Especially with that 5 nodes in 4 years bullshit I would LOVE to eventually come around to being long intel I just dont see it yet    So is this Stacy Rasgon and theyre afraid to mention his name He a clown who been wrong on X86 for too long boo this man I will sell AMD about 600 1T and buy INTC for 1015 instead Not this year but it will be so  Fell as soon as I bought it I went to 129 Im worried that it might fall to 110 in this situation Korea and the US went through a rough patch yesterday Why are you like this Is this a bad omen This one seems to be falling more than usual OOO They say the interest rate cut is delayed but this is quite serious isnt it its not even a smallcap stock Okay Its number one Mate Semiconductor stocks Samjeon flies tomorrow TIL the CEO of AMD Lisa Su is the cousin of Nvidia CEO and CoFounder Jensen Huang Imagine their parents flexing asian parent style on each other Bullish on AMD stock Theres no way Lisa is going to let her parents keep saying sure youre the CEO of one of the largest tech firms in the world but your cousins company is bigger Disappointing Imagine if quantum computing was cracked because of two elderly Asian ladies competing against each other through their children Jensen used to work at AMD And Jensen was close to being AMDs CEO AMD approached nVidia for acquisition before ATI Jensen agreed with the condition of him being the CEO of newly merged company AMDs CEO at the time Hector Ruiz disagreed and the deal was off Imagine Family gathering Their poor siblings and cousins Combined net worth probably bigger than the GDP of some countries Quick Google so correct me if Iwrong Lisa Su has a net worth of 11B Jensen Huang has a net worth of 756B Combined they have a net worth of 767B which places them below Azerbaijan 787B but above Ghana 737B as the 81st largest country by GDP out of the world 187 countries on the wikipedia article In case anyone doesnrealise that is an incomprehensible amount of money The human brain cannot comprehend how large 1 billion is 1 million seconds is around 11 days 1 billion seconds is about 31 years Check out this cool visualiser for the incomprehensible wealth of the top 01 As a taiwaneseasian Edit for all you commenting itnormal at 7 yo learning multiplication I just checked ittaught in 3rd grade so age 89 This lined up with my own memory as well We taiwanese started primary school at 7 too and we ainofficially taught multiplication at school at 7 I am not going to pretend this was a normal thing Some of us had attended abacus classes outside school and can learn this earlier Arent multiplication tables standard school stuff for the age of seven My kids had to learn them at that age Asians and math Ive never heard of such a thing They have Instancing enabled Saves a draw call when they in the same room No wonder Taiwan is 1 no wonder GPUs keep getting more expensive when both GPU makers are related They meet up every once in a while with their yachts in international waters plotting how to keep their monopoly looking like a duopoly That explains a lot Would the FTC jump in if any of Intel leadership marry into that family Being rich is a nice club and you ainin it so it runs in family The Case For AMAT Disclaimer I am long AMAT and have been for a couple of years Hi everyone Here is a model I have made for one of my favorite stocks AMAT On the site you can see a short write up explaining my assumptions and thoughts on the business Let me know what you think Is anyone else long AMAT httpswwwuseequityvalcommodeltickerAMATmodeld6f48d4ecdfd4c7bb5c90469f61494af I am considering Axcelis What are the advantages from AMAT over axcelis in your opinion AMAT is the second largest semiconductor OEM only ASML is bigger AMAT is the generalist with IP and production of the best most sophisticated tools needed by foundries They are essential without them the semiconductor supply chain collapses ACLS is tiny specializes in only one small part of the OEM industry for semiconductors ACLS has done pretty awfully despite great fundamentals while AMAT has grown strong for a very long time Axcelis is much smaller and really only has exposure to ion implantation right now ACLS is more high risk high reward in my eyes especially with the sic market correction occurring right now that could affect them as it did to other sic beneficiaries like aehr and wolf The US wants ASML to stop servicing its advanced chipmaking tools in China Report If ASML is restricted from servicing its installed tools at certain China fabs this could impact its financial results ASMLs service revenue totaled 607 billion last year and it could also face lawsuits from clients is the US going to foot the lawsuit bills without going into geopolitics and sides it doesnt seem likely this goes through In which country would Chinese customers sue them If this is a US and EU government policy then they cant sue in the US or EU They can sue in China but this would simply mean ASML could no longer operate in China at all which is likely the objective with the sanctions in the first place I work in the industry and generally understand the need for EUV level sanctions I even understand the requirement for no further DUV sales I do not work for a lithography company but the company I work for does sell other equipment to Chinese fabs subject to compliance with export restrictions I dont like the rug pull aspect of this Paid service of systems already sold is a reasonable expectation of past customers Its also an expectation for shareholders who invested at the time of or before those sales In principle this strikes me as a very anti capitalist request No RFKs Ok No CIPs Ok No service  Im sorry what I dont like the rug pull aspect of this Paid service of systems already sold is a reasonable expectation of past customers Its also an expectation for shareholders who invested at the time of or before those sales Its going to mean that the Western world is going to see less business for its capital assets in the future It means that the Western politicians essentially lied Western exports are already struggling against Chinese ones This is going to make a sales pitch even harder I work in the industry and generally understand the need for EUV level sanctions I would argue working in manufacturing that even the EUV sanctions are counterproductive All they will do is to make China invest even more money into developing their own EUV technologies and then the Chinese will be able to totally decouple from the West At some point I would not be surprised if the Chinese surpass the West and I think this will happen much sooner than most Western politicians realize Perhaps this is because there are so few production managers or engineers in senior roles in the Western political system as opposed to China which is far more engineering heavy in the CPC Leading in semiconductors is a function of getting the natural resources to make the capital goods the money involved and having the engineers China is graduating a huge amount of engineers Just a literal setback All this is doing is pushing China to be independent Eventually well hit a wall in which due to physics we cant shrink chips which will allow China to catch up China was such a back water country 40 years ago and now theyre overtaking America in infrastructure where it counts In NYC the most populated city in the richest nation on the planet they have subway stations in which people can be shoved into incoming trains China has subway stations that has partition walls  doors that that only open once a train has stopped with its doors open How long do our leaders think these sanctions will hold China back DUV is an open tech at this point They have already restricted EUV isnt that good enough I mean DUV tech is known but its implementation is still very hardbut agreed it going to make China rush to compete with ASML Can uncle Sam just mind his own business  This is not right Not even a joke It goes up slowly and comes down in just a few minutes,0

2024-04-08,"ASML annonces affordable housing program !ping BENE&YIMBY This was kinda slept on - ASML is funding 379 units in the short term. Private sector compensating for the government failure to authorize more housing ASML has a direct interest in this, they need more workers and needs to house them too Also my bad for the typo in the title Workers will be allowed to live inside the EUV lithography machines when not in use. They just have to self-certify ISO:1,000,000 cleanliness after a bedtime shower. Countdown to Asianometry video on this in 3??2??$ASML Apple Chipmaker TSMC to Receive $6.6 Billion Grant to Step Up Production in the U.S. I?셪l believe it when this is built and people are employed. Remember the Foxconn office in Wisconsin? LOL, I applied while in Taiwan to be a trainer in the Wisconsin plant but they never got back to me probably because of the plant not happening. I actually didn?셳 know that there was one, what happened with it? They are already building 2 other plants, production is expected to start in 2025 and 2028 respectively. This would be the 3rd one TSMC Phoenix Construction Update #6 April 3, 2024 Phoenix, AZ 4K CHIP PLANT. tldw; construction of first fabs well underway TSMC is currently struggling to find enough qualified employees in the US. The birthplace of the CPU.. sad to see how things have come but hopefully Americans see their back against the wall and fight back before the goliath China consumes all. And unlike others, TSMC will actually get shit done.  Taiwan became a big player in chip manufacturing by sending its brightest students abroad to study and do research in the field before they returned back home . This was apparently a strategic move by Taiwan to become important enough to retain its sovereignty . Of course, this is just a random on the internet talking about some YouTube video so take this with a grain of salt. Chips are pretty huge for US national defense right now??been that way for a while. These fabs are the best of their kind and take years to build with highly specialized personnel and equipment. If China decides to move against Taiwan, the US has a strategic incentive to on-shore production so that TSMC can supply the west and potentially defend Taiwan. US is literally willing to have 1 Million soldiers, $10 Trillion to protect Taiwan mostly due to this company. If you think this is too much, you clearly dont understand the world. In EU, there are massive subsidies constantly being written up to compete, are you also going to say EU is wrong? Japan, Canada, South Korea too. It's absolutely a national security issue at this point. We can't be that dependent on Taiwan for chips. It's a serious choke point for the entire economy. I am regularly reminded that redditors comment with extreme confidence about on issues they have no clue about I mean the article is from Macrumors. Thst has pretty much nothing to do with Apple. Apple is just one of many customer of tsmc. The headline could have been ?얖MD Chipmaker TSMC to Recieve?╈?or ?얧VIDIA Chipmaker TSMC to Recieve?╈?and it would be equally true This isn?셳 the forum for it but to me this is another sign that we won?셳 be starting world war 3 over Taiwan. Earthquake in Taiwan Micron when do you recover For all the prospective interns in here, don't always take hourly pay into consideration between 2+ offers unless one is unliveable Unless you know for a fact the starting pay is significantly higher, it makes no sense arguing about 2 positions with different $/hr. Let's assume Company A gave an offer of this: $19/hr, MCOL. 15 week program Planning intern at corporate Industry is semiconductor And here's Company B's offer: $21/hr, MCOL. 15 week program Area management intern at a satellite crossdock/DC Industry is eCommerce A lot of kids would just look at the near term and think ""wow $21/hr I'll jump on it"".  Company A is in Planning for a semiconductor company . This has an insane ceiling with good benefits on a full time conversion . That's a 12-15 week program, so at most a difference of $1,200 before taxes . Unless you want to do continuous improvement or work on the floor, or you KNOW that the starting salaries are structured for FT conversions where wage is directly correlated to starting FT pay, Company A in this case will always be better. You should also think about industries you'd like to work in and if you see yourself staying for 4 decades. Getting into politics, where roughly would my beliefs fit for the USA? Hey, so I'm pretty young, 17, and am currently in the process of getting further into politics. While I feel like Social Democracy is the closest to my beliefs, I would like you guys, being more seasoned than me, to roughly gauge me on where I stand (USA): Universal, Single-Payer Healthcare. Stop the price gouging! Though, I do admit that the Public Option and Regulation should be tried FIRST beforehand. Gradual process, or it'll all fail. Similar coverage to those in Scandinavian countries. At the VERY least, similar to Japan's 70/30 payer system w/ strong price controls and caps. Sectoral Bargaining, Repeal of Right-to-Work laws Firearm control - Background checks and competency checks similar to drivers licenses. Mental healthcare must be reformed as well to reduce shootings. Reform the federal bureaucracy to make it more efficient and equitable to spearhead reformation. Police reform. At LEAST two-year college degree to become a police officer + enhanced investigation into misconduct.  I personally oppose Affirmative Action and hope that there may be a less obviously-dividing way of ensuring that historically disenfranchised groups get the assistance they need . Perhaps further investment, abolition of redlining and HOAs, and scholarships for impoverished neighborhoods . Of course, maintain minority protections for all other cases . Immigration reform - expand holding centers, streamline channels for proper immigration and the asylum-seeking process. Border Security cannot work without a proper, legal system that is adequate to those seeking asylum and immigration into the United States. Withdraw from Guantanamo Bay. Binding Referendum on the statehood of all US Territories. Full funding of public schools and universities. Free tuition for college and trade schools. Fund schools via a STATE-wide fund collected from property taxes instead. Expand homeless shelters, mental healthcare. Decriminalize drugs BUT make rehab mandatory, build enough shelters and harsher penalties for purchase, sale and transport of drugs FIRST, not like what's happening in Portland and Seattle. Expand protections for women, LGBT people. Get rid of the gender pay gap. End Transgender discrimination, especially, given what's happening right now. Abortions allowed up to 6 months, after that medical, r*pe, and other necessary cases only. Legalize Weed completely. Stronger Secularism - Forbid religious involvement in politics. Though, not to the level of France's Laicite. Workplace Democracy, empowered unions and a 50% combined stake of workers in companies. Support worker co-ops. Ensure that the working and middle classes get an actual stake in growth + prevents easy backsliding to neoliberalism and ""trickle-down economics"" (fuck you Reagan). Nationalization of key industries - Infrastructure, utilities, telecom, healthcare Ban lobbying + Stronger preventative measures against the ""purchase of legislators"" Environmental investment. Regulate the fossil fuels industry whilst slowly replacing them with cleaner-energy jobs. Nuclear power.  Increase the corporate tax rate to 40% Increase the top-marginal income tax rates to 60% Rid of the ""TurboTax BS"" Rid of companies like Intuit who profit off of the complexity of tax filing . Land Value Tax? Don't know about this one, but it seems quite popular. If so, implement it and reduce taxes in general, moreso on the median-income and lower classes. Rent control and forbid corporate-owned housing. Electoral reform. Abolish the electoral college, proportional representation, ranked-choice voting, and re-empower the Voting Rights Act of 1964. Prohibit gerrymandering, BOTH PARTIES must be reined in on this. Increased funding for entrepeneurship and small business startups. Actually tolerable and humane social housing. YIMBY (though smartly, don't scare away everyone or this whole thing does under) Fund American semiconductor industries, chipmaking industries. Better fund the Department of Veterans Affairs and allocate some of the military budget to other sectors. Stand our ground against China and Russia. Slowly implement UBI of $600 a month in the meantime, while reforms to lower housing, healthcare and other living costs take effect. Gradual shift out of means-based welfare. These aren't all of my beliefs, but are what I believe to be the most important to me. What do you guys think? Some are probably a bit incoherent/contradictory, since I'm still new to this. You?셶e been assigned: hufflepuff honestly though, it's a shame that posts like this even exist. people seem much more focused on the labels of political ideologies than actually talking about policies I think I've seen much more argument on the definitions of socialism and liberalism than actual discussion of policy, which is pretty silly when you remember that these ideological labels are created by men to help us simplify often disparate sets of stances. But at some point we've turned these ideologies from labels to describe into rigid guidelines to aspire towards Why would you desire to fund education through property taxes. It's just such a weird thing to me. Such a middle class tax. While in my country Belgium we fund education through all of our taxes. Top 10% of Belgians pay 45% of all taxes. (2018 stat). We would lower our median net wealth if these middle class people were forced to pay the education bill through such a flat tax. Educated workforce labour for gigantic corporations. Let the profiteers of these corporations foot the education bill. You should just vote on the democrats, you don't have much of a different choice. You fall into Bernie Sanders territory which isn't shocking because of your age. As you start working you will be more aggravated by paying taxes. My Belgian government hides most taxation and at the end of the year the labourers get money back, which is very smart imo psychologically. After careful review of the points espoused by the comments, I have realized that my approach bears a ton of problems. Here are my responses: These ideals are far too idealistic and far-reaching, with their definitions being too broad in nature and not practical in the sense of who pays for what. This post distinctly lacks a coherent political philosophy and plays into the trend of ""What X am I"" that is prevalent with people who are not well-versed/fresh/naive to this. Accordingly, I will ensure that I focus more on policies and discussion of ideology.  While people do say that I'm a ""commie"", some of these policies, I do certainly believe and do so whist believing in my obligation to help others . I fully admit that my more far-reaching ideals, such as worker-shares, co-ops, the land-value tax, of weed, of firearm control, healthcare I support college education for police officers, like Europe does, in that it will likely increase the time needed to be dedicated in order to become a police officer, thus reducing bad apples. ""Specifically, officers with a four-year degree use force less often, use lower levels of force, receive fewer complaints and disciplinary actions, and write better investigatory reports than their non-college educated peers."" https://calmatters.org/justice/2021/03/mandate-higher-education-for-california-police-officers/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20officers%20with%20a%20four,their%20non%2Dcollege%20educated%20peers.  The culture surrounding health must be reformed and we must place a wider focus on PREVENTING such problems, such as better regulation of foods and perhaps the establishment of a food health rating system . 6. RESPONSE TO LITHOBOLOS (https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1bznf4j/comment/kyqvy7a/) - REPLY TO THIS COMMENT. None of my points will be perfect. While I hope to clarify my points, concede where I am wrong, and give a wider view of what I believe, I fully understand that I bear major flaws with regards to politics, especially given my inexperience. Somewhere between social democracy and liberal socialism. If you're a socialist in the west, being a democratic one is almost a given and it doesn't say anything about what kind of socialism you want. Seems like social democracy. I agree with a lot of this although I'm farther left economically and would support broader nationalization and public housing replacing homeless shelters entirely. The most important thing is to get politically active and organize. Whatever you choose to believe, please do not get your info from reddit. The subreddits here on either side tend to ban any dissenting opinions and are very much echochambers. Police reform. At LEAST two-year college degree to become a police officer + enhanced investigation into misconduct. By whom? Any government agency is going to protect government police, unless they need a scapegoat. Support worker co-ops. Currently there is nothing stopping people from forming co-ops. Nationalization of key industries - Infrastructure, utilities, telecom, healthcare Why not just do the whole economy. If nationalization of healthcare provides better outcomes than the market, why not nationalize housing and food production? Both of those are easier to produce than healthcare. You'd be right in line with most Americans and an extreme leftist commie according to most American polititians and the media. am currently in the process of getting further into politics Pls don't, it is worthless to get into it. But since I'm sure you'll do it regardless, here is my tip. Before going out on a savior mentality, or like a central planner fixing everyone's problem, try to explain why it happened in the first place. Why would you want to learn the cause? Think like a doctor, a patient comes with headache and fever, those are two simple symptoms that are easily treated, but if he only threatens the symptoms, the real infection would still run rampant and get back even worse. Instead of treating the symptoms, strike the cause. For example: Stop the price gouging! The US has plenty of market, products and services, and some really necessary for our survival like food, water and clothing. Why is the health sector so good at price gouging when other necessary areas aren't? What is causing all of this? Get rid of the gender pay gap Fuck, i didn't know it was this easy. Let's just get rid of the gender pay gap. While policies are important, I feel that a political philosophy is more important to develop. What makes a policy good? What problem is it trying to solve? Who should pay for it? Who should run it? Who should benefit the most? These are questions that only a political philosophy can answer coherently and consistently. Even then a lot of policy positions are simply gut checks in the present moment and change with the times. Someone might say they think Russia shouldn't invade and try to conquer Ukraine. When asked why they might talk about human rights or how wars of aggression shouldn't be rewarded etc. Yet the US has had multiple wars of aggression and has kept territory from them.  Putin hasn't killed as many people as Nixon or even GW Bush, but we don't talk about those men the same. Why?  Why does abortion rules change when it comes to rape?  ""Because she didn't consent!"" But we know consent can be given and taken back because all people have bodily. Why does a woman lose her autonomy when she becomes pregnant?  ""Sorry, you said yes once and it's too late to let you stop this!"" Is that statement being said by a man or the state? Again, philosophy is the key. It's how we think not what we think. I highly recommend bell hooks to start off with.  And I already hate you. Lol Jesus christ almighty, this sounds like bureaucratic hell. Suffocating and tolitarian. I think I'd rather unalive myself than live in this. And if this is what Europe is like, thank God I don't live there. Idealistic. You might be more of a Scandinavian socialist? But idk that you really fit into politics in America. Well, your policies are unamerican, so there's that. What is the difference between being a social democrat and democratic socialist? I think both would like the same immediate changes. If there is a distinction, democratic socialists want to eventually go further. Nice ideas are fine. But where is the political force to implement them? Is there a chapter the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) nearby? One of their founders, Michael Harrington, always strove to seek ?쁳he left wing of the possible?? I encourage you to get involved with DSA. I have not been for some time. I strive to publish journal articles pointing out that what most economists teach is nonsense. Social democrat is a capitalists who wants a strong welfare state paid for by taxing the rich, and democratic socialists is normal socialism with the word democratic in front of it.  Have your boomer parents or uber started talking about NVDA, AI? Is it time exit this ride. Preface this with I'm a big NVDA AI fan been on the AI train for years before this 2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price. https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/ I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong. Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE  I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath . I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top . Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top. EDIT: I just think it?셲 way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there. Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter. It was easy to see it?셲 very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the ?쐓treet??or ?쐌arket??pivots quickly. 5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance. https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/  When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it?셲 almost like a landslide in stock price . And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won? Join WSB Discord My boomer dad follows stocks so he was familiar with the NVDA ticker although had no knowledge or interest in what they do. Last Christmas he asked me ""what is this AI thing about?"" Alien Inbreeding, its the new hot thing ~ This is so simple and accurate. Yeah my dad and I were chatting about it over the weekend. For context this is a guy who managed to lose money during the 2021 bull run. So yeah I think the ship has sailed One of us I went to a lawyer event and retired silent generation attorneys were talking about AI (although grossly misunderstanding it). It might be time I hate how incredibly reactive this sub is, if the market is bullish this place is full of bulls saying i told you so, if its bearish, its full of gay bears saying i told you so. At least the bulls are positive though. Been holding since $11. I gotta say, it?셲 been quite the sight watching you commoners from the rafters. 40% IV @$800+ is pretty wild. The only problem with your analysis is it is wrong. !remindme 3 months Imagine if you had exited when they found out about AAPL or AMZN or META etc. You must not like money. My boomer dad invested an undisclosed five figure sum into nvidia over five years ago and then again a couple months ago. I think my dad is secretly a millionaire now lol. if your dad had 5 figures to casually throw into a single stock five years ago before anyone really realized NVDA was going to be involved in the AI boom then your dad was already a millionaire. Better convince dad to get a good will in place hey hey kids, if an imaginary coin sitting in an imaginary location in an imaginary wallet with an imaginary address can go to $70k+ then nvidia has lots of juice to go up. End of story story time kids so go back to your desks and open the robinhood account and start gambling with nvidia, arm and pltr and stop waisting time. I used to think that shit was true, but the internet has changed the game of information. Don't get unnecessarily bearish just because people know about something! That said, current P/Es are kind of whacky and AI very well might be oversold in the way the internet was with its bubble. Very well could be a period where AI related and NVDA stagnate for 5-10 years before all of a sudden someone/some people really find a good use case for it, kind of like what social media / the iPhone did. I think we could be closer to the 5 year part however, too many people out there already using AI and the internet to learn and be prospects for doing something great if they keep at it.  The huge net profit number keeps talking to me. Could it drop 10-15%? Sure. But it will climb back up. Will it drop 30%? Don't think so. Trust the information in earnings reports, trust your own reasoning . Yaaayyyyy this is the post I've been patiently waiting for. Top confirmed gents. Stairs up and elevators down?삇 Wall Street Bets are my boomer parents New hire at TSMC. Looking for Advice Hi, I will be graduating with MS and I have already secured an offer from TSMC for a project engineer position at AZ. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST FULL-TIME JOB (I am 22) and I am interested in moving forward in the semiconductor field in my career. I like the field (I have done projects and internships in this field) and it's booming.  I wanted to get some real advice from people who have worked/currently working/working in the same field about what I should expect as a new grad/fresher coming into the industry . As this is my first full-time position I am preparing myself well for this opportunity . I believe the position I got hired for pays well for a  I also wanted to test myself to see if I could get even better opportunities than this . I am reaching out to people from the semiconductor field to get a few more interviews from different companies that work on semiconductor chips . Please suggest to me what companies I should look into which may give me a competitive offer . Thank you to all of you kind people in advance! Left Intel to work at TSMC, was there less than a year before returning to Intel.  All of the training material was in Chinese and I was tasked with translating it using google translate . Taiwan is AMAZING. I would trust them as far as I could throw one of the lithography machines . 100% look up what standard safety practice is (Lock out/tag out, chemical gear, when safety googles are needed (hint: wear them in the fab 100% of the time, they don?셳 provide them), when you need to tie off at heights) and stick to them. No job is worth your life. Idk if this has changed in the year since I left, but I don?셳 think any non-Chinese speaker is gunna get promoted to management there. So I wouldn?셳 stay long term. Intel, Amkor, Micron, and NXP in Phoenix are good companies and Samsung in Texas I?셶e heard good things about. So, does TSMC not push safety like Intel? Intel has very high safety standards and heavily implements LOTO, stopping the job, etc. CoHe is a priority when completing PM / troubleshooting tasks. I totally agree with it. No one should risk their life for a job. As someone who work as an MT, I always wonder how serious safety is in other fabs, mainly TSMC... It's mental that they don't provide safety glasses Sounds scary. I will be more careful now. I don't know manderian too. Do you recommend me to learn it before I go? I work with a few guys who went to TSMC and came back to Intel within a year. Consensus seems to be that it?셲 very disorganized and safety concerns aren?셳 taken seriously, but my sample size is like 3 people, so YMMV. My only advice would be to trust your gut if something doesn?셳 seem/feel right and speak up. These are extremely dangerous chemical plants. For what I've heard, TSMC is quite a workaholic environment. Maybe consider it for a short-term contract (1-2yr) and then move to a competitor What job position? The advice depends a little bit on that (i.e. process engineer vs equipment engineer vs facilities side etc)  Work at an OEM vs Contract Manufacturer (Fab vs Foundry in the semiconductor industry) is night and day! OEM is SO much better. I would guess that it would be a good experience and that you'll learn a lot . OP, I might be able to refer you to a company. I'm also curious about your current pay. DM me if you're interested in chatting further.  Taiwanese don't like their employees argue with them so if you think what they do is wrong you still have to carry it out until it fails . Never argue with you boss even if what he told you is wrong . I?셶e heard awful things about this mandatory relocation for TSMC onboarding. Look into Texas Instruments, they are building massive expansions in Dallas and Lehi locations. And tons of people I meet at TI have worked there for 30+ years. With plenty of other semiconductor doctor companies in their backyard that kind of retention says a lot. From the title, sounds like you might be working in semiconductor construction. Is that right? Right. construction project engineer. All I am saying from a financial standpoint is they have enormous financial strength better than a LOT of companies and might be a key contributor to technology down the road. Stick it out and congrats I was at the grocery store by TSMC the other day, and a guy and some other guy were yelling at each other. Like full blown, high volume anger. The manager made comments about the workers wife. And the workers didn't find that acceptable, and let him know with his fist to the managers face. I've heard alotta stories like that. Should I buy calls or puts for earnings? This. Please go up  All shareholders  TSMC position update Day open vs Day close Be the first to comment Nobody's responded to this post yet.
Add your thoughts and get the conversation going. Tomorrow in the Korean semiconductor market Do you see the light U.S. offers TSMC up to $6.6 billion for Arizona factories as Biden pushes for chip security Wonder if they?셪l keep trying to impose their Asian work-life structure onto its US employees I just clocked in a 60 hour work week at a normal tech job in the US. I think its already here my bro. The big lay offs just left the rest of the team to pick up the slack. Job postings from TSMC: -Must have a PhD
-Must be willing to worth 80 hours a week. -$14.35/hr I've heard from many, many electrical engineers that TSMC is a horrible company to work for and they don't respect different culture work styles whatsoever. They treat their USA staff as poorly as they treat their Taiwanese staff which is apparently horrendous. Why Arizona? Why not go to some depressed area that has a lot of water? Intel already has fabs there and they don?셳 have to setup suppliers or anything like that from the ground up. It wouldn?셳 shock me if they later try to setup fans in Ohio as well once Intel?셲 new site is more established  72% of our state water goes to agriculture so shifting it to high GDP industries like chip manufacturing is a good move . We use less water now than we did in 1980 even though the population almost tripled . https://www.arizonawaterfacts.com/water-your-facts#:~:text=Surface%20water%20from%20lakes%2C%20rivers,season%2C%20and%20place%20to%20place. As long as they hire union and stop trying to skirt safety regs. I?셶e been in semiconductor industry 25 yrs Incentives. Companies are less likely to be attracted by loans. IC's are a strategic resource, and it costs billions and billions of dollars a year to maintain/operate a fab. Ghods why AZ? Why not Eastern Washington state? Cheap power and water.. Why in gods name Arizona though? Chips need water and benefit from being near industrial centers like ports or heavy water transportation. Is this some sad attempt to buy Arizona politics? I don?셳 think you can serious bring down the labor price on chips. Would it not make more sense to build a massive factory in the northwest and Midwest where water is cheap, or California and Texas with their industrial harbors. I agree with and think you're on to something. It could also be a national security thing. Not wanting the plants to be close to places where earthquakes hurricanes could hit. California is AWFUL to operate in, not to mention cost of living for the workforce, and the taxes on businesses and people.....There is a reason they are losing citizens in droves...  One of the reasons that China is not invading Taiwan is because of the amount of high technology fabs that are located on that island . If China attacks Taiwan, then the fabs are going to get hit and totally throw a monkey wrench into the entire world economy even China doesn't want that to happen . Issue isn't money, but labor disputes and the clash between how TSMC operates and how unions in the US operate, and the clash of cultures. But the extra money is likely to smooth over those issues. Would my beliefs be counted here? Hey, so I'm pretty young, 17, and am currently in the process of getting further into politics. While I feel like Social Democracy is the closest to my beliefs, I would like you guys, being more seasoned than me, to roughly gauge me on where I stand (USA): Universal, Single-Payer Healthcare. Stop the price gouging! Though, I do admit that the Public Option and Regulation should be tried FIRST beforehand. Gradual process, or it'll all fail. Similar coverage to those in Scandinavian countries. At the VERY least, similar to Japan's 70/30 payer system w/ strong price controls and caps. Sectoral Bargaining, Repeal of Right-to-Work laws Firearm control - Background checks and competency checks similar to drivers licenses. Mental healthcare must be reformed as well to reduce shootings. Reform the federal bureaucracy to make it more efficient and equitable to spearhead reformation. Police reform. At LEAST two-year college degree to become a police officer + enhanced investigation into misconduct.  I personally oppose Affirmative Action and hope that there may be a less obviously-dividing way of ensuring that historically disenfranchised groups get the assistance they need . Perhaps further investment, abolition of redlining and HOAs, and scholarships for impoverished neighborhoods . Of course, maintain minority protections for all other cases . Immigration reform - expand holding centers, streamline channels for proper immigration and the asylum-seeking process. Border Security cannot work without a proper, legal system that is adequate to those seeking asylum and immigration into the United States. Withdraw from Guantanamo Bay. Binding Referendum on the statehood of all US Territories. Full funding of public schools and universities. Free tuition for college and trade schools. Fund schools via a STATE-wide fund collected from property taxes instead. Expand homeless shelters, mental healthcare. Decriminalize drugs BUT make rehab mandatory, build enough shelters and harsher penalties for purchase, sale and transport of drugs FIRST, not like what's happening in Portland and Seattle. Expand protections for women, LGBT people. Get rid of the gender pay gap. End Transgender discrimination, especially, given what's happening right now. Abortions allowed up to 6 months, after that medical, r*pe, and other necessary cases only. Legalize Weed completely. Stronger Secularism - Forbid religious involvement in politics. Though, not to the level of France's Laicite. Workplace Democracy, empowered unions and a 50% combined stake of workers in companies. Support worker co-ops. Ensure that the working and middle classes get an actual stake in growth + prevents easy backsliding to neoliberalism and ""trickle-down economics"" (fuck you Reagan). Nationalization of key industries - Infrastructure, utilities, telecom, healthcare Ban lobbying + Stronger preventative measures against the ""purchase of legislators"" Environmental investment. Regulate the fossil fuels industry whilst slowly replacing them with cleaner-energy jobs. Nuclear power.  Increase the corporate tax rate to 40% Increase the top-marginal income tax rates to 60% Rid of the ""TurboTax BS"" Rid of companies like Intuit who profit off of the complexity of tax filing . Land Value Tax? Don't know about this one, but it seems quite popular. If so, implement it and reduce taxes in general, moreso on the median-income and lower classes. Rent control and forbid corporate-owned housing. Electoral reform. Abolish the electoral college, proportional representation, ranked-choice voting, and re-empower the Voting Rights Act of 1964. Prohibit gerrymandering, BOTH PARTIES must be reined in on this. Increased funding for entrepeneurship and small business startups. Actually tolerable and humane social housing. YIMBY (though smartly, don't scare away everyone or this whole thing does under) Fund American semiconductor industries, chipmaking industries. Better fund the Department of Veterans Affairs and allocate some of the military budget to other sectors. Stand our ground against China and Russia. Slowly implement UBI of $600 a month in the meantime, while reforms to lower housing, healthcare and other living costs take effect. Gradual shift out of means-based welfare. These aren't all of my beliefs, but are what I believe to be the most important to me. What do you guys think? Some are probably a bit incoherent/contradictory, since I'm still new to this. GEGEN Papen, Hitler, Thalmann. I'd say that you're firmly on the left side of social democracy. Seems like you are a Solid SocDem. Absolutely, these are beliefs that are well received here. All of your beliefs align very much with those of social democracy. Where can I vote for you? This looks actually closer to democratic socialism than social democracy, given the emphasis on nationalisations and workplace democracy why wouldn?셳 we? we allow anyone here as long as they?셱e respectful. Pretty solid Left Social Democrat Yeah this fits pretty well here. I personally would do some of the things you mention here a bit differently, but overall you fit comfortably into the SocDem realm. For example: Taxation and Welfare. At first, I used to support Universal Basic Resources, but I've come to create a new proposal that, theoretically, would not only do far more to eradicate poverty, it would make tax compliance extremely easy, and it would great boost tax revenues. My idea? Negative Income Tax + 25% VAT, and possibly a LVT. A Negative Income Tax is a very easy to understand tax system, in where if you earn below a certain amount, you get a payout from the government, and if you earn above a certain amount, you pay a tax. This is the formula I would follow: 0.5 x ([Earned Income] - $48,000) What does that mean? Well, say you earned $0 all of last year. According to this formula, you would receive $24k in a direct payment. This not only functions as a de-facto welfare program, it also works as a very easy to understand tax system. You'd have to be mathematically incompetent to screw up the calculations. With this, I would eliminate all other welfare programs (except Medicaid). The amount we spend on Social Security & Welfare (excluding Medicaid) combined, is more expensive than what my proposal would be. How expensive would my proposal be? $1,660,053,014,670, assuming the current 342M US population estimate is correct. If, lets say, you had an family of 4 that was completely lacking any source of income, they would collectively receive $60k at the beginning of the Calander year. $24k per person, $6k per child. This would be astronomically more in benefits than any social program we current have would ever provide a family of this size. How much tax revenue would this raise? From what I could calculate, it'd bring in $3,034,801,668,360 in individual income taxes. More than the $2.18T we brought in last year. So such a scheme would pay for itself. And then the Value Added Tax. From what I could find online, countries with a 25% VAT are able to capture 10% of GDP in tax revenue. So, applying that trend onto the USA, a 25% VAT would net us $2,778,000,000,000 in 2024. That means a VAT + NIT would net the federal government a total of ~$5.81T. I would use this fact to eliminate all other forms of taxation. After the NIT payouts, the federal government would be left with $4,152,748,653,690 to spend. How would a potential budget look like? This is my idea: Department of Education: $370,500,000,000 ($5000/pupil) Total Spending: $3,671,336,000,000 That would leave a $481,412,653,690 surplus this year. Now of course, budgets (to my knowledge) are not calculated like this; in fact almost every single agency listed her would be getting significantly more funding than they current do. So real spending would potentially be even lower. So, with my idea, I believe that not only would it eliminate poverty; it would also be significantly cheaper than our current welfare spending (We spend ~$1.8T on Social Security & Welfare excluding Medicaid), and such a system would actually raise tax revenues for the government, allowing the government to have a balanced budget. If there is any budget shortfalls, then a 5% - 10% federal land value tax should easily be able to cover it. That'd bring in well over a trillion per year in tax revenue, if my own calculations are correct. As for lowering the cost of living? The HUD as seen in my budget proposal would have an objective to build enough rent controlled housing to accommodate a 5% population growth in a year. That would mean, in this year, they'd have to build and maintain 17.1 million rent-controlled housing units. This would be the pricing for each apartment size: 1 Bedroom: $600/mo 2 Bedroom: $900/mo 3 Bedroom: $1050/mo Every additional Bedroom, add $150/mo to the cost This would mean a family of 4 would spend $1050 at most 21% of their income (assuming no earned income) on housing. A family of 6 would be spending at most 25% of their income on housing. Both of which are far below the federal recommendation of housing not taking up more than 30% of your income. And since there is going to be so many housing units across the country, it'd place downwards pressure on private rental units and homes as well, further lowering the cost of living for everybody. Everything else, I fully agree to. I propose a 1 Representative in Congress and The House for every 50k people. This would leave us with 6840 Representatives, as it currently stands. This is good and real social democracy; not the 3rd way knockoff You are between a democratic socialist and a social democrat. Since you support nationalization I would probably catagorize you as the former Id say you definitely lean left within social democracy but so do I. Welcome!  The Voting Rights Act guarantees the formation of majority-minority congressional districts . This of course presupposes a first-past-the-post system . So by doing proportional representation (presumably through the use of multi-member districts) you violate the Act . Hello social democrat. If you want more things to study to understand nordic style welfare, I would search up the three worlds of welfare capitalism (there is a wikipedia article on it.) Land Value Tax/LVT is popular because the tax can?셳 be ?쁲helved??to unintended groups. LVT is also popular in urbanism. Hi! Did you use wikipedia as your source?

This was running natively on the Meta Quest 3 at a nice stable 120hz :) . u/nezticle thanks a lot for your help For those interested to see this in 60fps (reddit is meh 30fps) https://youtu.be/OfkBJw1OxmM?feature=shared Nice. How did you get the Meta Quest to work with Ubuntu?  We've been focused on improving XR input (both interacting with 2D content in 3D, as well as just generally speaking controllers and hands interactions and gestures). We also just started working on the visionOS support, and hope to also support immersive mode there with QtQuick3D.Xr in the 6.8 release .  Designing the API abstractions in such a way where everything makes sense across OpenXR and xros sdk alike is impressive and seems like a massive challenge . I hope the module stays in tech preview for a long while after release so the team has some freedom to revise things if needed . I wanted you to throw the whole tower so hard :D The Tower umand your hands are really nice but the robot seemed to be a bit u precise. Good work! Haha, I shouldn?셳 have cut the video there indeed. I have footage of it falling over.  The in-preciseness and choppyness of the robot is exactly why it is so interesting . It stems from the robot, not the headset! It uncovers an actual issue we have with our robots . Each of our robots localize themselves using onboard cameras and broadcasts their position via multicast . if we make improvements, it is immediately visible and gives us visual feedback Ufffff, LOVE IT!!!! In what programming language is made ? QtQuick uses mostly QML to define what is in the scene declaratively. Then if you need specific custom things like the position of the robot from the wifi multicast packets I use C++ to make this object and instantiate in QML with the QML_ELEMENT macro from qmlengine TSMC March 2024 Revenue Report - Record Im just happy TSMC didnt get hit by cpi Today should have been a memorable day for the stock. Beyond disappointed that this is happening as a result of something not in their control It got hit too. It would have jumped to 150+ easily if cpi data was not hot It could only get hit by china, nothing else can stop it to moon.  This stock should easily be at $155 now reviving up for earnings . This whole things is pissing me off. While a stock like djt goes up based on shit this company is making tons of cash yet they keep dealing blows from Powell, earthquakes, cpi and massive drops . I just lost 4k in calls, tough day for us wtf happened to it today? Down 4 bucks. They can seem to break free from external market bullshit. Hoping for the best next week TSMC Q1 revenue rise beats market expections Join WSB Discord And yet it still can't get traction in pre market. It's almost like someone's snorting the ELF out of this stock for some reason. I must admit I don?셳 get this stock. It might be the most important company in the world because if China wants to take Taiwan the US is willing to start WW3. Without it does Apple have enough chips, NVDA, AMD, MSFT, AMZN, META, GOOG etc have enough chips? The majority of AI seems to be on the back of what this company makes. Yet there?셲 4 comments and it seemingly blew out earnings? (Maybe just not enough of a blowout) But it seems the west is willing to start ww3 over this company for its computing and AI production and it barely moves. Owned this for a long time and my AMD, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN just blows my TSMC positions. Maybe I?셫 just salty it hasn?셳 kept pace with the ultra high flyers. Did it even go up $1 after earnings today? It dropped hard today lets see what happens this friday TSMC monthly revenues record March. https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3125 11% of this is Nvidia rely? Great news for semiconductors. As Jensen says, demand far outpaces supply when it comes to AI lol, I?셝 certainly hope so or we?셱e f?셝  All of our futures are tied up to what NVDA does, and NVDA is in a leadership position . I have never felt more comfortable with a stock in a downdraft . Like NVDA could go down to 600 and my outlook would be the same because there will be exponential growth in computing . well, lets not go down to 600 just to try out those feelings. lol But yes.... this stock/company IS amazing! What does this mean to nvidia? Nvidia wouldn't be ordering big from TSMC if they aren't confident of the orders coming in obviously.   To also ensure the orders are maintained, Nvidia is likely to sign contracts where sales are locked in or penalised for cancellation. yep yep I enjoy playing with my Huang. Water-guzzling chipmaker TSMC and drought-plagued Arizona are an unlikely pair, but Phoenix says it has enough water maybe they can stop growing alfalfa in the fucking desert to free up some water. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/climate/arizona-saudi-arabia-alfalfa-groundwater.html It's happening Unlike the water used for alfalfa and dairy cows in Arizona, most of the water used in chip manufacturing can be recycled (up to 98%). Chip makers recycle most of the water they use. This is a much better economic use of Phoenix's limited water resources than... say... growing alfalfa for Saudi Arabians... They can just cut back on the Saudi alfalfa. Already did. Or started to. One lease was terminated due to violations and I think three more valid leases will be allowed to expire. Drove by there a few weeks ago and couldn?셳 believe how massive those fields were. I actually wrote software for the semiconductor industry. Most of the water is used for cooling, and therefore recycled. 72% of the state's water is used for agriculture, 6% for industrial use, and 22% for all municipal uses combined Chip fabs are not water guzzling. This is a misleading title. Much of the water that is used is reclaimed https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/feature/thirsty-chip-facilities-under-scrutiny-in-water-stressed-areas-82810#:~:text=Technology%20enables%20chipmakers%20to%20recycle,water%20resources%20even%20more%20important. The vast majority of their water will be sourced by the company themselves. Intel has already been there for decades and decades and uses just as much water. This video explains it all Glad someone linked this. Water usage in Arizona is overwhelmingly related to agriculture due to western water rights. The reality is that the western US in general needs to have a conversation about water rights. TSMC is absolutely huge plus, not just for Arizona, but for the entire US, and the article is doing nothing to but creating more confusion on the subject.  The water situation is different for each city / part of the metro . City of Phoenix has secure and established water rights and supplies, as do most of the older cities . Places with issues are new developments on the outskirts where they don??ÂÂ³ have no water rights . When there is no water water rights don?셳 matter. Phoenix is a time bomb that doesn?셳 even have a desalination plant to try to save them. Downstream of everyone is not where I would want to be in 20 years. Their water reuse and recycle is ridiculously efficient. No!!! We?셱e supposed to always be mad and scared based on headlines and assumptions! /s Free hot water to the city! During the summer you don't even need the hot water tap, the ""cold"" water is warm enough to take a pretty comfortable shower. Yeah, we got enough water for this. No problem. But the citizens are on their own. If only there were other parts of the US where water is plentiful. Why some people get angry when an AMD card is recommended? Every post that someone asks for a gpu recommendation, some people seem to be offended that an AMD card is suggested on the lower price tiers (300$ and below). Why is that? I currently own a nvidia card, I am happy with the product, but I have owned AMD in the past (rx 580) and it was great. Suggesting gpu brand that I have? Upvote. Suggesting gpu brand that I don???have? Downvote. I have both so I upvote and downvote at the same time I always think back to TotalBiscuit talking about fanboism that often applies to video cards, consoles, phones, cars.... Anything with a high price tag. People need to believe when they were deciding to spend all this money, they made the right choice. They need to justify it however they can, because they did their version of research and there is no way they could have gotten wrong when spending all that money. So when somebody else suggests something other than their choice... It's saying to them, they were wrong. They were stupid. They spent all that money and they got it so wrong. So people get really defensive of products that aren't their choice. Even if my needs are not the same as your needs. There can be no nuance. I must have gotten right or else that wasted money would be painful to think about it. I agree with this, so I'll upvote this. I've owned both, I'll continue to own both, there's pros and cons to both. Same. I simply don't care if it is a GeForce or Radeon, as long as the feature set and price to performance ratio is good, it gets my thumbs up. Honestly I've noticed the opposite. If you want to buy an Nvidia card, you get yelled at for being an Nvidia fanboy and must be poor with money when you could buy the much better priced AMD equivalent. Oh and if you say you've had issues with AMD drivers, you get told by others that that was years ago and doesn't happen anymore. Even if that directly contradicts your own experience! This pretty much sums up both sides Once you read Linux channels, it's totally opposite - amd is recommend, while Nvidia is generally hated. That's quite hilarious. Different use cases, nvidia cards do not work well in Wayland (modern Linux graphics system), because for a lot of years nvidia refused to support Wayland and did not develop the necessary drivers.",0
2024-04-10,"Holding up better than expected Will the discussion of splitting shares come up How to be cost optimised per Txn compared to others All Have you done anything like cost optimisation competitor analysis and what did you do differently to be cheaper  Layeres : Web App (angular micro front end app) + internal and external API( APIM, redis, ASB or serverless) + DB (mongo), other monitoring tools like new relic, Kibana, Elastic search .

Is AI realtime automation can help like CAST AI says ? Any other Idea or Perspective on this problem or opportunity? Using mobile to type, excuse me for typos. Most likely, that isn't what you really want. The last frontier of cost optimization is riddled with opportunity costs, and the ROI gets terribly bad. You should never optimize for costs. Otherwise, I'd tell you to shut down everything, fire everyone, 100% cost reduction, where is my bonus? Yeah not to zero but lower it in different ways and different from others. People cost is not in this per transaction scope. I'm not sure what you mean. It's very difficult to compare tools. However, I stumbled upon a unique tool that analyses network traffic and can allocate costs of all shared resources with a few clicks, and you can map cost spikes to what caused it, e.g., long-running SQL queries Would you be able to share the name of the tool?

Surprise, surprise, tank . Latest one I really liked, Intel introducing Gaudi3 as a capable NVDA competitor, -3  At this stock price Intel is trading only 43% above its book value . This does not take into account the fact that they plan to add 110 billion more to the book over the next 3 years .

As you can see, it has dropped further, but well, who said making money was easy? Enjoy wanking! Join WSB Discord intc's been so rekt and the overall geopolitics have gotten so crazy that going long on intc actually looks like a decent idea now. and i'm a long-time intel hater. No offense but the regards on WSB aren't going to care INTC until its gone 5x it's current price today. Do you think regards here we're buying NVDA before it popped? No of course not, they're buying calls now.. like alright. Nobody rode $90 META back up to $500 because they're too impatient. Same story with INTC. Wall Street wants retail shakes out, big whoop. Time is surely going to be needed, but it will pay off. The sentiment around INTC now is extremely analogous to AMD in 2015. And I see it at the Zen preview 2015 part of the cycle. Until there is more certainty around 18A, there isn't a real reason to be buying Intel at the moment, especially given market conditions. For those new to the sub. AMD was memed on for years from 2015 to 2018 before it finally broke out. This was 2 years AFTER the release of Zen 1. And keep in mind, AMD's long term goal was 20% of the server market in 2025 and parity with Intel in performance. Does that sound as bullish as leadership in processing by 2027? I bought from 30, rode it to 50 and sold at 42 at the news. I rather be in the market so I have about 70% OXY 30% GLD. I expect Intel to be a 200 stock at some point before 2027. I just think I can get a better entry, maybe even in the low 30s. Fuck intel. That being said, bullish long term  I have about 2300+ shares 1/2 my net worth in INTC (pretty regarded I know) and managed to pour in on both sides of the dip over the last few years . I'm drowning here and down about 20k between all my accounts with INTC over 3-4 years . Fortunately I held on to at least some INTC as a long term hold has made sense to me for years now with their change in direction, righting past wrongs of not adopting euv tech, foundry services, and the fact that they can actually manufacture chips seemed like a more stable business. Their current worth seems crazy low. May time prove us right! ???뙖 when intel hit 38$ few days ago, I sold nearly all of my portfolio off and now 80% of it is in INTC. Lol wtf. INTC is the only big player other than TSM that does the advanced chip fab especially for the more complicated DPUs and TPUs. INTC will moon in the next cpl years they r playing the long game. all these chip designers like AMD, ARM, SMCI will be snuffed out. when intel finishes there new fab they will be the ONLY full stack chip company that can do this. Hope u got long enough calls ?쁻 as a former long-term investor, when they lobbied for government subsidies and cut their dividend, i liquidated my holdings. and i refuse to invest in fabless semiconductor companies like nvda and amd that cannot manufacture their own products. with geopolitical tensions, tsm is a risk too.

I should buy semiconductors more Regarding internships at ASML Hey i just wanted to ask why does my application keeps getting rejected for internship positions . I recently graduated with a Bachelors and Masters degree in physics and have work experience in computational physics and material science . Despite me applying to the roles where the skills match my experience my application keeps getting rejected . Did you call a recruiter to ask? Don't know your location but in NL it's not even allowed to hire someone for an internship if they are not enrolled in education. So maybe try to apply for starter positions? This is the same in the US. Internships have to be filled by someone who will still be enrolled in school throughout the internship. Most interns in the US do their internships during summer break. I did messaged someone from HR but they said the position is filled that's all . Hmm i looked at some starter positions but for some of them they required some experince in litho machines Isn?셳 internship/on the job training(OJT) should be taken while you are taking your degree? If you are applying in NL you should be enrolled in a educational institutie otherwise you are denied directly, if you are already graduated you cannot apply for internships Currently an intern in Veldhoven. I had to apply to quite some roles that all matched perfectly or pretty well to even get an interview. but 1 interview was luckily all I needed but it?셪l take some time Solid LOL Its natural for assets to grow Take it How old is he The share of Micron will fall sharply sooner or later
Overbought US stocks I think its right to say that if youre a big gritzer youre just going US, Japan to unveil Luzon investment connecting 4 major PH biz hubs MANILA ??The United States, Japan, and the Philippines are set to unveil the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) Luzon Corridor that will usher in new infrastructure projects to connect Subic Bay, Clark, Manila, and Batangas. The PGII, founded by the G7 countries, aims to mobilize up to USD600 billion by 2027 to help narrow the infrastructure investment gap in partner countries. A senior US administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity during a teleconference in Washington DC on Thursday said the Luzon initiative would be the first PGII corridor in the Indo-Pacific and would be launched as part of the deliverables of the historic trilateral leaders??summit between President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., US President Joe Biden, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on April 11. The investment initiative, the official said, would ?쏿ccelerate coordinated investments in high-impact infrastructure projects, including ports, rail, clean energy, semiconductors, supply chains, and other forms of connectivity in the Philippines?? After the launch, the governments would set up a steering committee to accelerate the corridor projects. The US Development Finance Corporation will also open its first regional office in the Philippines as part of the announcement, the official said. ?쏻hen it comes to PGII, we do expect it will take some time for the full suite of investments that we?셶e envisioned here to come to pass,"" the official said. ""But as I mentioned, we?셱e standing up a steering committee of high-level US, Philippines, and Japanese government officials to ensure that we are steering private sector investment to exactly the types of projects that this corridor needs to improve, as well as bringing a full suite of US government tools to bear."" The official noted that the corridor and the recent US Presidential Trade Mission to Manila are testaments that Washington DC ?쐔ake very seriously??its work to help the country's clean energy transition and supply chain resilience, among others.

Chinese firms: yes Mr. PRESIDENT, God bless America! Once again, I contend that putting Huawei on the entity list was a mistake for this reason specifically. If hiring ASML engineers was all you needed to create low nanometer chips then every country would be able to make them. You also need top of the line parts across dozens of industries all currently controlled by western countries. Im not discounting China?셲 ability to catch up eventually but these devices are pretty much the pinnacle of human technological achievement. To put it another way: If China is able to catch up to the West quickly then Globalism was a failure and our wives left us for nothing. If hiring ASML engineers was all you needed to create low nanometer chips then every country would be able to make them The catch is having enough of them And of course, it's not like ASML isn't sourcing in China too If hiring ASML engineers was all you needed to create low nanometer chips then every country would be able to make them Every country is able to make them. But it doesn't make economic sense for a company in Mexico to try to build semiconductors itself when it's so much cheaper to import them and the startup capital is so high. But if you ban companies from exporting to Mexico, well suddenly it's not possible to import them, so Mexican companies start building them and start hiring ASML engineers to help them. They're also building a billion dollar particle accelerator to experiment with alternatives to ASML's lithography devices. It's a theorized area of research that no one else has invested in due to speculative results from a massive investment. But the Chinese sanctions have convinced them to try. If hiring ASML engineers was all you needed to create low nanometer chips then every country would be able to make them. Yes because trade doesnt exist. The relevant factor here is that china has been effectively frozen out of the market. Every other country both have more than ample access to ASML tech directly, which is relatively cheap for what it is too, and every reason to stay on good terms with the EU so it doesnt lock up ASML, and with ASML themselves. China obviously cant access new tech through normal channels so they alone have both the funds, industrial capacity, and now the burning incentive to do this. It's like half this sub completely forgets or ignores macro economics, trade, and comparative advantages when the subject of china and national security comes up. they have the same issue as other countries trying to catch up to them on EVs.... its about the ecosystem and not just the factories...

KX7000 and 3A6000 had bizarre janks like very high power requirements for low clock speed . In some tests they were slower than even mid-2010s i3 Intel . They were leap above the previous gen, but it's clear they are not close to AMD's 7nm. And as Intel vs AMD showed, with things like 3D cache and P-E cores, the feature size node nm is practically just gimmick today. The fact they're only maybe 2 or 3 years behind despite being hammered by sanctions and restrictions and starting years later makes me assume they'll catch up within the next few years at this rate tbh Man, you should really read up on early american industrial economics contra british. The steps are more or less identical with the americans producing substandard products and using every underhanded tactic imaginable to learn or ""steal"" know-how from british firms (and occasionally continental european firms) so that the americans could copy them and do things as well. Obviously that was a failed endevour by the americans of the early industrial era and the north american continent has been resigned to following in the wake of europe ever since. Right? Eh disagree. The main issue working with the current EUV and DUV is that if you try to move to 2nm and such your yields fall. It is possible to do so with current kit, but you're throwing away circa 70% of your production This is the kind of project that doesn't allow for corruption, it's a high priority one. If they track with current EUV it's good enough - UUV isn't commercially viable anyways Need a little advise on managing INTC I started not too long ago and sold a few puts on INTC during their last earnings week. I got assigned at 45.5, I know I should have rolled, but I was new and I was ok taking assignment since I was bullish on the stock. Now I'm having second thoughts about INTC, specially after their announcement that their fabs will not be profitable for another 4 to 6 years.  My current break even is 43 after I sold CCs. My loss, if I sell at the current price of 36.xx, will be a little less than 15% of my portfolio . This is not counting the income I made with selling premiums on the initial put and the CCs, I consider the premiums as my profit . With a I feel in the long term, INTC will come back, but it will not be anytime soon and I'll have my money stuck in this stock. I've seen chatter that people think it might get back in 40s sometime next year or even later this year, but I'm not too sure of that. What do you all do, have you guys ever sold the underlying for a loss so you can move forward? Or do you just keep selling CCs as a bag holder? Never assume you have any insight into what stocks will go up or down. Retail investors almost always make the wrong decisions. The fact that you feel bearish on INTC is actually a reason to be bullish. I think I've read about this before. Thanks for bringing it up. Are there any disadvantages to this play? Seems like I make money if the stock price moves in either direction as long as I roll one of the calls. Retail investors almost always make the wrong decisions. The fact that you feel bearish on INTC is actually a reason to be bullish. And thanks for the above. I guess I was bullish on INTC earlier, and it did not go my way, so yeah, I wasn't right. Your options: Double down, buy more and average down costprice sell calls below cost basis in the hope you'll lower your cost basis further sell the shares and open a synthetic for the same amount of shares. This will take less funds, so you can recover on a lower base. get out, look for better opportunities. I was in a similar position at the end of 2022. I sold my shares, opened synthetics twice the value of my original shares. I recovered quete well as the shares went to 45ish. Now at 36 I'm still green. They're long term positions though (end 2025) Thanks, this is a helpful list of options. I did think of averaging, but that'll be even more money in a single stock, and I don't want to end up with a majority of my portfolio in INTC. I thought of this as well, I mean if I am willing to sell at 36.xx, then I could sell a CC at 37.5 and make some money that way. If I get called away, It'll be at a better price than I was willing to sell at. I'll have to read up more on synthetic options. If you don't mind, can you give an example? Or maybe give the example of what you did with yours in 2022? Similar situation. Avg was $43. Had some CC that worked out well. Just sold at $36.xx and then sold ATM CSP with 5dte. If it goes up, I keep the premium. If it goes down, I?셫 still better off as I will get assigned but have the premium. Will try it a few times. Isn't that the same as not selling the stock and selling ATM CC ? If it goes down, you still have the stock. If it goes up, the stock gets called away and you collect the premium. In my opinion, selling would be suitable. You should sell.  Selling covered calls is for long term investors so I wouldn't recommend this . If you want to reduce basis aggressively you could sell the .50 Call naked . This will allow you to collect the most extrinsic value . Cut the position by half or more, then decide what to do with the rest.  15 percent of the portfolio in one stock, especially an underperforming stock is too much. If I misread and the dollar loss from selling is 15 percent that?셲 even worse.  Most common mistake is trading too big. Even if one trade wins, continue to trade big and crippling losses become near inevitable.  Remember to watch chip fabs Earnings Calls [List includ. in post] Obviously some are not listed such as Samsung and Siemens (foreign listed), or etc, and other lower tier fab companies.

I personally need to do more research. I'm not sure how much of TSMC's factories are dedicated to lower tier gear. ASML has shown that demand for lower tier is a bit down. (ASML is involved in high tier as well, mind you.) The demand for higher tier is through the roof.  TSM is the monopoly for high tier enterprise chip production, and they work with the above mention tickers . The only thing to gauge is how much the lower tier production will affect earnings calls this season . ASML has caused, along with fear, the sector to dip today and last night (ASML is foreign and dipped 7+% during closed American hours, American markets on open taking some time to then react). TSM is Taiwanese. The markets may react outside open hours. There may be delays in American market reaction. The earnings call will be from 1AM to 2:30AM CST Apr 18th as per their financial website: https://investor.tsmc.com/english/financial-calendar Along with my below response I have also posted this question and my response in several relevant subreddits, if it is of interest to you. Let's see what others say. Thanks! Bookmarking this :) of course and cool :) When is SMCI?  SMCI is a server solution company, not involved in the fabrication . If NVDA relies on TSM and like companies for fabs, SMCI distributes said product in custom builds for the end-users . DELL is similar to SMCI . In short, this post is about the fabs. I could do another post about earnings for the other parts of the ecosystem; they all affect each other.

2024-04-17,"ASML sets density record with latest chipmaking tools ??High-NA EUV equipment prints first patterns 90% of semiconductor demand is in legacy nodes (less than 14nm) which are the bulk of DUV sales to China by ASML. Unironically, China is said to be capable of 7nm and soon 5nm, which begs the question if this tech war is even worth the trouble for ASML.  Question: The resolution limit of High NA is 8nm, but this time it has achieved 10nm. That?셲 still 2nm away from the design target of 8nm. Alright, but what was the question? The resolution limit of the optics isn't the same as the resolution limit of the pattern you can print without defects. The latter depends on your photoresist, photoresist assist layers, and etch steps. The optical resolution of the NXE is 13.5 nm, but it usually gets used to print 18-20 nm lateral features. ASML's Twinscan EXE:5200, which is equipped with a 0.55 NA lens, is designed to print chips with an 8nm resolution ??a significant improvement over the current 13nm resolution of EUV tools. This technology allows for printing transistors that are 1.7 times smaller and achieve 2.9 times higher transistor densities with a single exposure, versus Low-NA tools. Quite clear, isn?셳 it?

President Joe Biden is scheduled to travel on April 25 to the Syracuse, New York, region as part of the announcement, the people said. Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, is building factories near Syracuse, as well as in its home state.  Micron has pledged to build as many as four factories in New York state, plus one in Idaho . The company is proceeding with projects in China, India and Japan as well .

Good earnings? Believe it or not, also red. The good earning pushed NVDA up. Good job TSM.  This current week is so fuckin stupid, they say good and its bad and they say its bad and its good like what??? And down it goes. The last time I played TSM earnings this same shit happened, they crushed earnings and tanked regardless I will never buy this regarding ass stock ever again I really don't understand TSM stock Been floating around 2% up for a month now.. not sure where it's ""priced in"". And now to dump back that 2%? I hate this market. How tf is it going down what kind of woodoo shit is this TSM stock is the most weirdest fucking stock I?셶e ever seen! What is the point of expectations if they?셱e expected to beat expectations by a certain amount? Maybe I?셫 just regarded but that makes no sense. The stock price will soar only when all of you have given up and sold at a loss. At that point, the stock price will rally to all time highs (not any time soon though) The TLDR of the earnings: AI chip demand is very strong. AI Server business is growing to become a larger piece of revenue. Should be 20% in a year or two by 2028 (seems conservative to me tbh). Other chip areas are declining (edit: partially due to seasonality but sounds like some beyond expectations). Auto chip demand is now forecasted to shrink versus expand. Smartphone sales slowdown is dragging on their smartphone chip line as well. Investing tons of capital into advanced technologies for mainly the AI space. Geopolitical risks remain high. In summary, they are doing well to transition the business to satisfy AI chip demand. However, areas of their core business today are seeing softening demand. This puts TSMC in a highly precarious position as continued AI demand means dominance while any slip could spell disaster given the high capital expenditures and receding core business areas in smartphone/auto. Regarded market I woke up and looked at my put credit spreads and thought China had invaded. Nope just good news about earnings. what garbage stock. my fault for having a little faith in you Yet it?셲 more red than your wife?셲 period In the discord forum of TSM, people are arguing that is down do to so many calls being expired tomorrow. It should go up by Monday.  I believe with so many calls being bought they expire 4/19 these that are covering those calls made sure the stock didn't spike . You could see it trying for a month. Up $5 then down. Even in the same day .

Overall, revenue from advanced processes (including 7nm and more advanced processes) accounted for 65% of wafer sales in the quarter. MVP Q2 revenue growth is expected to be around 8% 46% of revenues is HPC 38% is SmartPhone So far Apple has enjoyed the cutting edge wafers, but with this kind of reversal, it may actually shift things a bit. HPC may become the cutting edge node driver. Interesting times ahead. Whats hpc Interesting information. smartphone seasonality made 3nm sales half, decrease of 16% overall smartphone is responsible for halving revenue of 3nm... this is offset by probably AI this seasonality is continuing in Q2 Q2 revenue is gonna be same or better than Q4 23, an increase of 1,5B over Q1 This means 5nm sales are gonna be increasing quite a bit in Q2. I'm expecting AMD to increase their 3,5B target again (as Lisa already hinted on) by at least 1,5B to 5B for 2024. PT will hover around 200, anticipating 2025.

TSMC beats first-quarter revenue and profit expectations on strong AI chip demand Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the first quarter, thanks to continued strong demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications. Here are TSMC?셲 first-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates: Net revenue: 592.64 billion New Taiwan dollars ($18.87 billion), vs. NT$582.94 billion expected Net income: NT$225.49 billion, vs. NT$213.59 billion expected TSMC reported net revenue rose 16.5% from a year ago to NT$592.64 billion, while net income increased 8.9% from a year ago to NT$225.49 billion. The firm guided first-quarter revenue to be between $18 billion and $18.8 billion. TSMC is the world?셲 largest producer of advanced processors and counts companies such as Nvidia and Apple as its clients. ?쏤or the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality,??CFO Wendell Huang said during the firm?셲 earnings call Thursday. TSMC expects second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion. TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips. Strong demand for AI chips led by the proliferation of large language models such as ChatGPT and Chinese clones has caused TSMC?셲 shares to surge 56% in the past one year.  Continued demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications, is a positive sign for both the short and long term . The focus on advanced chip development, like the shift towards 3nm technology, is another factor driving long-term growth for TSMC . TSMC accounted for 61% of global foundry revenue in the fourth quarter, according to Counterpoint Research data. Samsung Foundry came in second with 14% of the market.  TSMC's net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company's history at 40%, against an industry average of 14% . The high margin is the result of an increased share of sales of 7nm and smaller chips, which have significantly higher margins . Last year, TSMC?셲 business was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and inventory adjustment. Smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips during the pandemic, leading to surplus inventories as Covid-era demand waned. Earlier this month, Taiwan was hit by an earthquake ??its strongest one in 25 years. A TSMC spokesperson said its construction sites were normal upon initial inspection, though workers from some fabs were briefly evacuated. Those workers subsequently returned to their workplaces. ?쏷here were no power shortages, no structural damage to our fabs and there is no damage to our critical tools, including all of our extreme ultraviolet lithography tools,??CFO Huang told investors and analysts on Thursday. EUV machines are critical in the production of the most advanced processors. However, some wafers were affected and ?쐆ad to be scrapped,??said Huang, adding that the firm expects most of the lost production to be recovered in second quarter, with ?쐌inimal impact??to revenue. The U.S. also recently granted TSMC?셲 Arizona subsidiary preliminary approval for government funding worth up to $6.6 billion to build the world?셲 most advanced semiconductors. TSMC is also eligible for about $5 billion in proposed loans.

Been fairly flat recently since ATH so probably priced in outside of a huge beat. Bought more this morning at $135ish, who knows what happens the next few months but they should be a big time winner over the next 5-10 years. TSMC is compared to other big players pretty undervalued. I doubt that Intel can be competitive for the same profit margin. Not flat, before today it was more than 10% off the ATH Why is it -2% in pre-market is the report seems very positive? Make it -4% I swear to god I freaking hate when they beat the earnings but the guidance makes everyone permabear.  Premarket price movement of a stock could be for any number of reasons, some legitimate, some not so legitimate . TSMC publicly makes available their financials on a monthly basis, so there's less of a surprise in their earnings report . It could be as nefarious as some market manipulation in the whee hours hoping to create an early trend Long term, earnings and profits are good and guidance is good to very good. Nothing about the earnings report should warrant a negative change in the company fundamentals for a long term investor. This will be bad for Apple.

Pretty much the title. ASML had a pretty bad ER yesterday and the stock has fallen 7.5% as of now. As a result, other semi conductor stocks like NVDA, AMD have fell a bit. Since ASML's customers are chipmakers like TSM, Samsung etc, there weak guidance could potentially signal signs of slowing down production for these companies? So could it be that TSM also gives a low guidance on their ER which could plummet their stock as well?

ready to go with plenty of RD ahead For those of you that dont know ASML is like stealthily one of the most important companies in the world ASML is the company that makes the machines that make chips ASML provides the machines to TSMC and other fabs Pretty much all of AMD and Intel chips for the past decade have used ASML They practically dominate the market with over 80 of the lithography machine market Hard to say it isn the most important company in the world by a significant margin Looks like an alien train engine NGL for a split second I saw it as ASMR machine I remember reading that those things are the most complex machines ever built by mankind Once they are shipped to their destination and fully assembled it takes another two years of calibrations adjustments and tuning for them in order to be able to produce chips with an acceptable enough failure rate I know what ASL is but what does the M stand for Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography Out of ASML LRCX AMAT and KLA which is the best in terms of value Ie been researching chip stocks and it quite fascinating how important each one of these companies are With the recent run up from AI it been hard to fine the value in each company but I curious what everyone else insight is AMAT stands out to me the most at the moment as it still a relatively low PE at 23 and it dropped 6 the last few days due to ASML and TSMCs earnings Most of the other manufactures are still around the 30 range or higher but in the long run I sure theye going to be amazing companies I think the only issue is how much these companies rely on selling to China and how that hurting their bottom line quite a bit Eventually that might change but I think that really unlikely for quite a while ASML and AMAT ASML is essentially a monopoly chip makers depend on that buys back a ton of shares Hold it long enough it will pay off AMAT is a generalist in semiconductors that does a bit of everything does it pretty well and will likely continue to be a resilient key player in the industry because of it All great essential companies Cant go wrong with any of them My personal favorite is AMAT They make the machines that make semiconductors which the demand for is only growing They are also not segmented to just one type of chip They make the equipment needed for both low end chips and high end chips Contrast this to ASML which has a monopoly on making the piece of equipment needed only in very advanced chips Additionally AMAT has rewarded their investors in both price appreciation and dividend income which they have committed to growing their dividend 20year for the next for years as of 2023 SMH is probably your safest route to avoid having all your eggs in one basket and being upset if the stock you picked slightly underperforms the others Lets be honest stock picking is very emotional with a lot of hindsight biases Thanks for the insight yeah Il probably just go with an ETF all the companies are better than just one I really like ASML and AMAT so why not just get the ETF which has both They are all about equal Forward PEs for three in the 2024 range ASML is higher and may be a bit more vulnerable to cyclicity because of the gigantic nature of their new device AMAT has a Justice Department lawsuit pending against them so if you only wanted one Id flip a coin between KLAC and LRCX tho klac is the one more fun to say If you can afford it Id suggest splitting your money between all four rather than pick only one Well that the issue I can I could choose something like SOXX or SMH but eh Gonna research more about KLA though I feel like an ETF would remove the stress of trying to pick one though for sure Does chip stocks truly follows a cycle I have been hearing about it but when looking at the stock chart the price doesn seem to follow a sin curve Ie been researching chip stocks and it quite fascinating how important each one of these companies are With the recent run up from AI it been hard to fine the

TSMCs earnings Most of the other manufactures are still around the 30 range or higher but in the long run I sure theye going to be amazing companies I think the only issue is how much these companies rely on selling to China and how that hurting their bottom line quite a bit Eventually that might change but I think that really unlikely for quite a while ASML and AMAT ASML is essentially a monopoly chip makers depend on that buys back a ton of shares Hold it long enough it will pay off AMAT is a generalist in semiconductors that does a bit of everything does it pretty well and will likely continue to be a resilient key player in the industry because of it All great essential companies Cant go wrong with any of them My personal favorite is AMAT They make the machines that make semiconductors which the demand for is only growing They are also not segmented to just one type of chip They make the equipment needed for both low end chips and high end chips Contrast this to ASML which has a monopoly on making the piece of equipment needed only in very advanced chips Additionally AMAT has rewarded their investors in both price appreciation and dividend income which they have committed to growing their dividend 20year for the next for years as of 2023 SMH is probably your safest route to avoid having all your eggs in one basket and being upset if the stock you picked slightly underperforms the others Lets be honest stock picking is very emotional with a lot of hindsight biases Thanks for the insight yeah Il probably just go with an ETF all the companies are better than just one I really like ASML and AMAT so why not just get the ETF which has both They are all about equal Forward PEs for three in the 2024 range ASML is higher and may be a bit more vulnerable to cyclicity because of the gigantic nature of their new device AMAT has a Justice Department lawsuit pending against them so if you only wanted one Id flip a coin between KLAC and LRCX tho klac is the one more fun to say If you can afford it Id suggest splitting your money between all four rather than pick only one Well that the issue I can I could choose something like SOXX or SMH but eh Gonna research more about KLA though I feel like an ETF would remove the stress of trying to pick one though for sure Does chip stocks truly follows a cycle I have been hearing about it but when looking at the stock chart the price doesn seem to follow a sin curve Seeking edge over rivals Intel first to assemble ASMLs nextgen chip tool httpswwwreuterscomtechnologyseekingedgeoverrivalsintelfirstassembleasmlsnextgenchiptool20240418 Intel was the first company to buy one of the 350 million euro 373 million machines made by top chip equipment supplier ASML ASMLAS The tools are expected to lead to new generations of smaller faster chips though there are financial and engineering risks involved Intels determination to be the first to adopt High NA is not accidental Intel plans to use the machine which is the size of a double decker bus in the development of its 14A generation of chips in 2025 with early production expected in 2026 and full commercial production in 2027 Shipping and installation of the massive tools may take up to six months giving Intel a head start Lol yes it was announced like three years ago Things take time in the semi industry but its rarely a surprise and very frequently not even news The news is that they finished assembly on it  I aint falling for it The US government bought it for them Intel keeps trying hard to recover its image and no one still cares lol Its going to be a while and take a lot of effort before Intel can have any edge over the competition The company is lagging so far behind in the most profitable area of the chip industry that its not even funny Semiconductor equipment maker ASML ships second High NA EUV machine It probably Samsung TSMC Japan didn intel bought several of them I wonder what Global Foundry might be using their 15B Chip Act funding for Seems like moving beyond mature nodes would be a good move for them in production of chips that meet US national security requirements Article only suggested it might be going to TSMC or Samsung and those seem possible too but they are well ahead on advanced node already GF would make more sense to jump ahead on this in the same way Intel is GF doesn have anything below 12nm And they disbanded their RD team There no chance for them to be at 3nm and need high NA It could be any of them including Intel Question is who is ready to receive it You do realize TSM just announced theyre pulling back on these type of orders and this is almost definitely for Intel TSMC Posts Q124 Results 3nm Revenue Share Drops Steeply but HPC Share Rises So Blackwell isnt going to be on 3nm Guess they are suffering too to get reasonable yield Consumer Blackwell wont use a more expensive process than workstation GPUs so I guees not Blackwell uses 4NP compared to N4 in Lovelace and Hopper which is obviously derived from N4P custom for their purposes If Blackwell for consumers is launching at the end of 2024 I would imagine the ramp wouldnt be starting in Q1 And I think TSMC only reports the money they made once they actually ship the wafers The A17 pro was really underwhelming on N3B Logic density gains were reasonable but there were no SRAM improvements at all Considering a large part of Nvidia GPU die is SRAM 96MB of L2 it is very likely that the cost of a new node did not justify the gains in performance Wonder if this stumble is something Intel can capitalise on Unlikely I know but an opportunity nonetheless As long as Nvidia doesnt need to go to a more advanced node to compete there is little incentive for them to suffering too to get reasonable yield Nah lol Its because most high volume designs on n3 are apples and apple sales are down massively N3bs also costly and is real close to n4p which makes n4p a possible alternative Most chip designers went with n4p instead of competing with apple for volume It aint really a yield problem 5nm should pick up sharply considering that even Intel is using theirs now TSMC to charge premium for making chips outside of Taiwan including its new US fabs CEO says I mean yeah They cant charge the same if their costs are higher when manufacturing elsewhere My guess is capacityleadtime become a burden in Taiwan and companies start forking over money for those advantages alone That makes perfect sense TSMC is paramount to Taiwans national security there was always going to be a catch to fabs outside of Taipei Feels like that was always obvious Theye just double dipping on the CHIPS Act money and charging extra These fabs are all going to close down in 10 years time after producing fuck all chips Shutting the gate after the covid horse has bolted a couple of years of normal world trade and politicians will lose interest the money will evaporate and they will close Youre probably right At least the abandoned facilities will make for cool urban exploring videos in the future Cool now I bet Samsung will follow for their foreign fabs pricing too Imagine a dark future where well be accusing fabs of colluding like dramflash cartel has Memory is a commodity that is very sensitive to small shifts in supply and demand Of course it highly manipulated Every quarter we hear about firms clamping capacity or consolidating their production base It for this very reason that the current top manufacturers remain in business Foundries on the other hand are heavily reliant on volume for yields and providing an outsized profit pool to pull from for your new major process node That is why a firm that is ahead like TSM wouldn ease up on the gas to share volume and profits with competitors When you are in a position of strength and the enemy is in retreat you advance Its a cost that is passed down to consumers That not really how it works If a company could get away with selling a product at a higher price they already would be Thats fine as long as they actually get the US fabs to happen sooner than later This news didnt sounds good at all for us consumer We really need Intel to stop TSMC monopoly I hope Intel dont have supply issues with 20A and 18A This Intel is looking very good and even if supply issues with 20A or 18A at first they will eventually be alleviated like all their other nodes have been Yeah They have to make big changes to their supply chians for this New materials alternatives will have to researched and tested too Very expensive undertakings  we have intel screw this lol TSMC liek HAHA YER FUCKED GIMME MONIE Fair trade is better than free trade any dayseems honest as they should Seems reasonable howeverif theye received Government support for land  construction costs I hope that they bear that in mind tooequalization the costs to that which would have been incurred by transportation to make the price the same regardless where it made would seem a fair endgame goal Sure and countries could then add tariffs to Taiwanese made chips to offset the difference And we gave them several billion on top for the privilege of paying a premium Look it so simple different cost structure subsides don really change the price of fish Stop believing the people that just want to whine and don understand the economics Same people that were all for outsourcing as it made so much TSMC They are getting help on capex Not opex They are getting help with tax Does not change their global cost structure  Yeah those chip fab plants are multi billion dollar plants Fair enough they charge more Tax cuts and free land doesn even scratch the cost to build one of those plants ESPECIALLY anything in the 5nm space EDIT I are potato and got my  backwards thanks for the call out When TSMC will pay their American scientists and engineers what theye worth and stop trying to bring in their national scabs Il have a little sympathy for them Til then Il just keep doing my thing at the fab that pays me for my education and skills 5nm",4
2024-04-19,"Cheer up NVDA bulls  I'm always way early, so I might be bag holding NVDA for a year or two, but I added at 787 today . Unless you think US deficits are going away anytime soon, stocks will be back to ATH in no time . [4/26 edit - sold position at 860) Join WSB Discord Stop doing things that make sense, this is a casino. 50 shares worth of NVDA buys plenty of 0DTE next week regard. You need a H100 for mining now. Would explain why Peter Thiel estimates a BTC price of at least 40k for mining to be profitable. How long is ""in no time""? And what does this chart have to do with it ??what do you see in it? It could rebound, but might as well go lower  Unless you think that the US is going to balance its budget, the federal deficit is only going to go up . When the deficit goes up, the Fed has to create more dollars out of thin air and send them to the US Treasury to finance that deficit . But that doesn't automatically lead to inflation... what really matters is the velocity of that  The risk is that I have to hold for longer for gains because it dips further or way down, but because it's still a growth company with valuable products, I think it'll get back to ATHs . As for NVDA specifically, they have really high margins and a protective moat for the next couple years at least . NVDA to $500 confirmed Rlly ? Exactly. I have the same issue with being chronically early as well. It's weird to spend months pointing something out and suddenly it becomes the top story an entire quarter after it was public Everyone Its 1137cmI dont know when to water it Its reaching 140 Ive been talking big all this time NVDA Thoughts  Greedy Banks were caught offsides as they should have been because they have monkeys for traders . They didn't hedge the Heavy Call options purchases and that is why post ER the stock couldn't rise past $1k even though NVDA is growing at 300% YoY .  The fact that NVDA's PR post-GTC Event sucked monkey balls is another factor . It's like the investor relations department went on vacation and decided to let the media do their work for them . These thoughts arent pulled out of thin air but formulated from actually being downtown in the trenches ""On Wall Street"" literally for a number of years. You'd be amazed at the debauchery that exists. All that being said the Banks (Call writers) have mitigated their wrong-side trade exposure and will probably let NVDA run again. Nothing is certain but it seems that way to me.  People don't like change especially when their portfolios are unprepared for it . Managers have been playing up Apple for so long as a cornerstone for all portfolios they are afraid of looking regarded if they try to right the narrative now . Going into NVDA ER I will be accumulating on this weakness. My ideas tend to be a bit more aggressive than most and always have been. It's worked for me over the years but my ideas are only my opinions. As always consume at your own discretion. I can see your play here. They are likely to crush earnings and this drop is really big. Question is have all the sellers been shaken out? I think it?셲 gonna drop a little more next week. Maybe till wed. Depends on market a bit. I don?셳 know tho I?셫 regarded  A momentum move with that much energy generally has some follow thru . NVDA is still the new Leader in Mega Tech for the time being . So what?셲 the benefit for the market makers and call writers? To make all the call options worthless, including mine? Or to get this to a lower price so their whales can load up again? I listened to the asml and TSM calls and found nothing bearish about AI chips. TSM said they are seeing ?쐖ery very strong demand?? ASML had some delayed orders last Q but it was mostly in the 3nm nodes but they believe the orders will come in in Q3 and Q4. 3nm are for aapl. Mobile. Not NVDA AI datacenter chips.  Rarely does a company gain popularity so quickly on the street as NVDA has . The Banks are in self preservation mode. The Banks were taking it up the ANOOS because they are obligated to take the other side of the trade at market price . Nvidia, $NVDA, now down 9% today. http://twitter.com/1200616796295847936/status/1781405134804627847 somebody must know something about the upcoming appropriation bill... sending billions of military weapons to Taiwan... will have some consequences....to the stock market. I wonder what trades Pelosi did before this downtrend.  The most significant computing revolution since the invention of the internet is underway and its entirely based on NVDA chips . The only limit to their revenue is how fast they can make chips . Isn't Intel releasing new AI chips this autumn that outperforms NVDA? Just something I heard BuT pEloSi Will it become toilet paper How many basement floors are there Will it fall further  Ill support you for two daysEveryone lets do it You were WARNED about $840 Support  NVDA formed a double top at $970 a share and that the downside risk was the stock potentially crashing to $700 if it lost its $840 support . Well that is exactly what happened today . The stock is down 10% in a single day in a loss of its support level . I?셶e worked as a professional trader and as a former hedge fund manager for 26 years. I can tell you right now that support and resistance levels are taken very seriously by professional fund managers. The point of this post is to illustrate a principle lesson here. That no matter how strong a company?셲 fundamentals, no stock trade in a vacuum. All stocks are subject to broad market buying and selling. There is no fundamental reason for today?셲 sell-off. It?셲 all technical driven. You can read my post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1bohmok/nvda_double_top_970/ The smartest among you will realize that when someone outlines very precisely what is likely to happen and it happens, maybe there?셲 something to it. The post very clearly outlines support and resistance levels and a downside target in a breakdown of support. $840 was the stated support levels on a $130 double top. The downside target is $710 on NVDA. It is very oversold now and likely to see a huge rally any moment now. But hopefully you?셶e learned something here. Certainly it wasn?셳 very smart buying anywhere near $900 and that much was clear when NVDA formed a double top at $970. The market was telling you something. NVDA will still get through $1000 by this summer. But buying at $700 for a 50% gain is better than buying at $900 for a 10% gain. Good luck! Yes but how many times have you cried wolf and you were wrong? 2 months ago he/she was predicting NVIDIA at 1300 within 4 weeks :-))) https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1b7bs8o/nvda_1000_highly_likely_now/ They/then came here to rub it in everyone?셲 face I guess This is just a panic sell based on the SMCI sellout, which is again a guess by an analyst. NVDA will recover! Thanks.Im buying. I have been waiting for such an opportunity for the past few weeks. I was hoping to buy it in the low 800s. I never thought i could buy it in 700s. I have no money to put in that isn't already in. I just ride the dragon. Dips happen. When I log in and see the bloodbath, I log out and not worry about it. The whole market is crying blood right now, but it'll pass. You were right, but I don?셳 care, I am long long long on this so ups and downs don?셳 matter. My average cost is around 220, so no worries. Good. Just stick with it. The fundamentals are unparalleled. I haven?셳 seen strongest fundamentals in a stock since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. The biggest mistake to make is to sell or trade it. Just hold it for another decade. So you know where Apple was trading in 2008? A full year after the iPhone came out? It was trading at $0.20. Imagine if someone plugged in $1M and just held it. Do the math. Time in the market beats timing the market. I foolishly listened to that advice and bought at 900.

You guys are thinking all wrong. War. Taiwan destroyed? Invaded? Compromised at the very least. TSMC stops production? No. TSMC temporarily resumes production in America, Japan, and other fabs under construction right now. The world will not stand by and let a global event disrupt the supply chain. They learned from Covid How are they possibly going to get enough water for fabrication in ARIZONA??? No real implications for us Well from a production capacity it is given and is a representation of the challenges that TSMC has expanding their fabs outside of Taiwan. They approved the Fab in Phoenix Arizona in November 2020 and broke ground December 2020 it seems like it's about to start production in late 2024 or early 2025. In Japan they were able to break ground April 2022 and they just opened last month. The Phoenix Fab is producing 5nm wafers the fab in Japan is manufacturing 40 nm, 28 nm, 22 nm, 16 nm, and 12nm.  Based off the article it seems like they have issues overcoming cultural challenges in the U.S. TSMC has been fighting with local leaders and unions in the states and I don't doubt they have more supply chain challenges .  NVDA needs TSMC to develop more fabs of their advance fabrication processes in order to continue growing . It's an issue if TSMC doesn't continue to increase their capacity which is why people were so interested in their CapEx during their last earnings call . TSMC does have a direct impact on NVDA and it's competitors. Just from 7nm to 5nm I believe it represents like a 30% reduction in power consumption. For cloud service providers they care about the cost efficiency hardware but energy efficiency is a significant consideration as well. I think this article is the most comprehensive and accurate publication I've seen on what it's like to be a US hire in TSMC - and if you go on PTT (basically Taiwanese Reddit), you'll see so many comments in response to this article like ""They finally found what makes TSMC number 1 - practical slave labor that doesn't fly in America"" Worth the read. I'm sure they will figure out something out.. too much money riding on this. I just read this. This is exactly why my dad got out of engineering for TRW. Foreigners impose their totalitarian ideals upon their American colleagues. American colleagues fight back as Americans have been taught since this country?셲 inception. Foreigners win and American?셲 get replaced by green cards. I always knew the work styles of the Taiwanese and Americans were incompatible. Americans have worked hard for protections from companies. Taiwanese worship their employer as God and enjoy the social status of working somewhere ?쐇mportant?? Americans care less about who they work for and care more about compensation and work life balance. That being said the US was smart as if World War ever breaks out, Taiwan will be obliterated and we will have an advanced fab in Phoenix which is heavily protected by the military. On a side note, it shows how stubborn and ignorant Taiwanese workers are that they will not assimilate to American culture. If you wish to work here, you must learn English fluently. Not the other way around. Wash rinse and repeat to any foreign company that builds here. Thats counter to capitalism. Yes they should learn to speak fluent English, but those who are willing to work harder and longer should naturally be compensated more.. and the answer should be green card status. The US needs more hard workers and less lazy entitlement. Very interesting article. I'm sure something has to he done in order to find a balance between the Amesica. Culture and the Taiwanese culture. The company looks not prepared culture wise. The expansion in America seemed not a voluntary move. Inside TSMC?셲 struggle to build a chip factory in the U.S. suburbs  U.S. engineers told Rest of World that some Taiwanese male engineers had calendars with bikini models on their desks and occasionally shared sexual memes in group chats . One former American engineer said some local co-workers referred to him as a ?쐗hite breeding pig,??implying he was only in Taiwan to sleep with local women LOL Wow, my take went from ?쐎ver sensitive Americans??to ?쐒acist as hell Taiwanese??at the speed of light. Seriously, the hell is that?  Quoting and responding to every major thing in it would go over reddit's comment limit . I think the real standout is how the former CEO who stepped down at age 86 and is held in such high regard as to still hold sway, is openly and publicly shit-talking the entire project and the people working on it . Real great attitude that will That the chips these fabs (incl Samsung Intel etc.) are outputting have to be sent to Asia for assembly, then sent back for final sale adding another long transport step, really doesn't help the notion that the endavor is purely political though. Many trainees, including Bruce, relied on Google Translate to get through the day, with mixed results. Technical terms and images were hard to decipher. One American engineer said that because staff were not allowed to upload work materials to Google, he tried to translate documents by copying Chinese text into a handwriting recognition program. It didn?셳 work very well. ""You need bilingual language classes and some human translators that are fluent in both languages available for trainees at all times."" There, my consulting fee is $1mil, should be a steal compared to whatever corprospeak crap a Big 3 gave them. TSMC leadership shouldn?셳 have expect to move the Taiwanese work culture here too. Tech workers in America are very different, they will not settle for that work culture. There?셲 an Intel fab in Arizona that?셲 undergoing a major expansion. Any engineer who doesn?셳 want to deal with TSMC?셲 culture can just go across Phoenix to work at an American company. What were they thinking? What shock me in all of this is Taiwanese engineers not being able to speak english. (I'm saying this as a french engineer) Can someone translate this comment? I dont speak french  All of this shit should have been cleared up at orientation meetings where a clear and unified company policy would be handed down, like ""In the United States, open displays of gravure imagery near female coworkers is considered sexual harassment, this is a job not a fucking frat house"" to prevent leaks employees surrender their smartphones and are given phones without access to social media Take a good look, America! This is what it takes to work those factory jobs you missed so much! You wanted these jobs back! Go ahead, turn in your smartphone! Work a 12 hour shift! Isn't this what you wanted? Isn't this why you sank the TPP and elected Trump? Uh... Id say that losing access to your phone is common in alot of US based manufacturing already. Almost every food manufacturer has taken my phone upon entry to the floor. Take a good look, America! This is what it takes to work those factory jobs you missed so much! You wanted these jobs back! Go ahead, turn in your smartphone! Work a 12 hour shift! Isn't this what you wanted? Isn't this why you sank the TPP and elected Trump? This ranting is not necessary, personal phones probably should be restricted in many/most workplaces. Fuck these guys, I'm going back to Intel Intel new fabs in Arizone are underway and on schedule. Apparently they did delay the Ohio one to rush these 2. Maybe industrial policy was a bad idea after all! Just to be clear you can absolutely build state of the art Fabs in the U.S. Intels Fab project in Arizona is going just fine. This is specifically a failure of TSMC to operate in a foreign market. Literally American Factory 2019 movie  The Taiwanese engineers brought with them the intense TSMC work culture . They were used to long days, out-of-hours calls, and harsh treatment from their managers . In Taiwan, the pay and prestige were worth it, they told Rest of World . But the American workers didn?셳 have the same sense of loyalty. In the U.S., engineers had a plethora of job options that provided competitive pay and abundant personal time. Translation: despite the stereotypes, American workers are immensely more productive across the board It's nice to have some pushback on the ""unions bad"" slant a lot of the original reporting on this story had. I originally posted this in r/taiwan but I guess the moderators didn?셳 like criticism of TSMC  I interviewed here and didn't get the job, but it was no hard feelings . The interviewer told me straight up it was in office and would be more than 40 hours a week . I'm currently full time remote and overtime is rare . Anyone else have the same experience? Turnover rate is so high you would probably just ended up looking for another job. If I was college age I might take the job for experience and a bit of world travel. But zero chance I would wanna work there as I'm approaching 40. We in the US really need to fight for healthy work/life balance. Productivity plummets with those crazy hours anyway. It's pointless. Pay was much lower than average for my position, technician/engineering roles. No work life balance, up to a year of training in Taiwan, I?셫 not sure how they expect to hire, let alone retain talent. Maybe abuse new graduates for the resume recognition or visa holders like a bunch of the other tech companies do. Struggle or not, this is a project that is a very high security concern for both U.S. and Taiwan governments. Failure is not an option for either side. It would be nice to see corporate Taiwan stop treating it like Taiwan. They still seem to just not care and think they can push Asian work culture in the US. In reading this, I remember when I worked at Motorola here in Arizona. In the 1980s into the 90s, it was the state's largest employer. Chips were made and middle class lifestyles were had. As Motorola had a union presence in Chicago, we benefited from that. We had a credit union, scheduled raises, good health care among other things. In the 1990s these all closed down and the fabs moved to China (I assume Taiwan) and sooner or later Walmart became the largest employer. Quite the step down in income potential as well as career potentials. I worked with technicians, engineers and other professionals at Motorola, I don't think those jobs exist at Walmart stores. Now they are bringing Chip manufacturing 'back', but with less jobs and probably at a lower pay (adjusted for inflation) and benefits. Those who say this will improve the education system here should recall that Intel is doing quite well in Chandler despite the ongoing attempt to make education in Arizona an international joke. We?셱e calling that empty area the Phoenix suburbs? That?셲 a bit of a stretch lol Yeah technically it?셲 Phoenix proper. I just hope that we get an LA-style Chinatown on Carefree and 51st once this thing gets up and running. It?셲 already starting. I live off of Carefree Highway and the local Albertsons has gone from being all fake tits and Trump stickers to about 1/4 Taiwanese. It?셲 excellent. As an Anthem resident I would love an H-mart or something similar to make its way to the area. My fianc챕e works here. It?셲 clear TSMC is trying to cut corners in an attempt to get the fab running more quickly. Their standards are lower than Intel but there is a lot riding on the fab?셲 completion for all involved. I hope TSMC is able to realize that operating in a different country means adhering to their labor standards. Such a shit show in there. I worked internally and everything they say in these articles is true. The turnover rate is horrific lol. Come to America, do things OUR WAY OR GET OUT Yeah, this will happen when they offer 60% of average pay for the positions they need to hire for. I mean??Isn?셳 the guy behind this project the same guy who swindled $500m in tax payer dollars from the Obama administration with the Solyndra failure? Are we really surprised this thing is another shitshow? Working for a semiconductor equipment supplier I was given the option to work there instead of Intel. For the same pay I would choose Intel any day of the week. Was thinking of applying but wasn?셳 too sure, things like this make me wanna stay away lol Having been in the semiconductor business for 30 years, TSMC is widely regarded as one of the more difficult places to work in the industry. No surprise they have high turnover. Long hours and high stress are apart of the industry, but some places, like TSMC, take it to another level. meanwhile the TSMC-Japan chip fab that was announced 1 year later, has already opened in Kumamoto. in fact, a second was announced at its opening. I would bet that the second just announced japanese chip plant will ship its first products before Arizona plant manages to The Japanese one is more mature process, 22 nm though? But I bet the culture does play a factor  U.S. engineers told Rest of World that some Taiwanese male engineers had calendars with bikini models on their desks and occasionally shared sexual memes in group chats . One former American engineer said some local co-workers referred to him as a ?쐗hite breeding pig,??implying he was only in Taiwan to sleep with local women One former American engineer said some local co-workers referred to him as a ?쐗hite breeding pig,??implying he was only in Taiwan to sleep with local women... Bruce spent his weekends hiking and frequenting nightclubs. ?쁻 the entire complex will cover 1,100 acres, or the equivalent of 625 football fields. We dont know what this means, Americans. American here. You could also think of it as about 300,000 double cheeseburgers arranged side-by-side into a perfect square on the ground Once again proof that Americans will use anything but the metric system. Anyone just LOL reading this? Taiwan work culture sucks; I said it. Interestingly, two days ago, the same post was removed by the mods because ""it has already been recently posted in r/taiwan. When you post, please try to be sure that your link/topic hasn't recently been posted."" https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1cb8hek/inside_tsmcs_struggle_to_build_a_chip_factory_in/ I read this article the other day and it was pretty interesting. Reminds me of the Netflix documentary ?쏛merican Factory??as someone else mentioned which is about Fuyao, a Chinese company. It is also a very interesting documentary to watch. It is too bad that this culture clash is occurring, but it isn?셳 surprising.  Taiwanese-Americans who have spent time in both countries and have a good grasp on both cultures and languages would be good for that role . I can see how American adults who have already worked at US companies are having a difficult time . Hopefully TSMC is not dead-set on getting the American workers in line to be just like their Taiwanese and Japanese workers. I don?셳 think that Americans engineers will fall in line the way TSMC leadership would prefer them to when they can just change jobs to a different US semiconductor/chip related company and go back to a work culture that they understand and prefer. Phoenix too of all places is rough! I don?셳 think I?셝 want to live there. Although if TSMC is successful here perhaps it can be another spot in a major US city that Asian population can grow, and I?셝 love to see that. INB4 locked ?뵏 People who have been to the US don't understand that nobody wants factory jobs in the US. Even if the factory is a fancy chip fabrication site. Also given US unspoken racial hierarchy I wonder how non-Asian Americans will handle Asian management and leadership. This ""Gung-ho"" American way is better isn't going to cut it. Because there are TSMC factories all over Asia now (ie. China, Taiwan, Japan, etc). What you said is highly prejudice, the U.S. workers are willing to work factory jobs, doesn?셳 mean they want to take shit though. Obama?셲 American factory is a documentary on Fuyao glass, a Chinese company, setup factory in the U.S. worth a watch for you  Most ignorant comment I?셶e read yet. I?ä�e spent 6 years working in the semiconductor industry . Even as a technician in semiconductors it?ä� hardly a ???�� job??unless you?ä�e an equipment technician/engineer . The fact that ?쐅ung ho??is the Chinese word for ?쐗ork together??and has been integrated fully into American culture is quite ironic, considering you make a baseless point that boils down to nothing more than r/americabad because rAcISt I've spent 6 years in the semiconductor industry, also... worked in both the U.S. and Taiwan... and agree with your take. Key point is people confuse ""Asian management and leadership"" with ""extremely complicated high-tech manufacturing management and leadership."" When you need thousands of things to go exactly and precisely right in order to produce a chip, this is the requirement. I've first-hand heard the U.S. side respond by saying, ""whites rule the world."" Recently, there was the case of the NXP CEO - on video - saying TSMC executives got on their hands and knees to meet with them (I'm certain it's a joke, but saying it... makes it hard to build trust). Racial hierarchy? The ceo of Nvidia is a Taiwanese American . Can Taiwanese say some white guy?쫇lack guy is a ceo of a company over there ? If there is any racial hierarchy it would probably be most apparent in East Asian countries . Taiwan worker's submissive culture won't work in America. Great Article. ""The American engineers complained of rigid, counterproductive hierarchies at the company; Taiwanese TSMC veterans described their American counterparts as lacking the kind of dedication and obedience they believe to be the foundation of their company?셲 world-leading success. Some 2,200 employees now work at TSMC?셲 Arizona plant, with about half of them deployed from Taiwan"" They are struggling, because they are trying to not use American workers to build the place or work in the place Managing a losing call on INTC  I am relatively new to options and currently holding a big losing position in INTC 06/21/24 39 C, that I paid a pretty penny for at 8.70 . I am bullish on intc in the long run. I need some advice on how to proceed. As a fellow INTC call bag holder, our best hope is they knock out the earnings in 2 days and it starts a run up. In the meantime I bought a few cheaper calls in hopes it will help dig me out, but it could just add to it. We shall see. I would hold it because you still got time. INTC is near at its support level around $34, so if it needs to move up it should do so shortly. Your goal now is to breakeven or maybe even recoup half of your investment, forget about profits. Just hold it, its not doing anymore harm.  I rarely try to intentionally play earnings but I?셬 just throwing $150 at it . Might as well see what happens over this week, or since your stuff is near worthless, no harm letting -95% get to 100% at this rate . But try to avoid getting into a down 95% situation!  To break even, INTC will have to hit about 47.70, and that's not within the expected move . If the ER isn't a blowout, then I'd bail and get out with what's left . From the sounds of what you're saying even with a blowout IV crush is gonna get him either way. its only worth $70 so might as well just wait. If the earnings is a blowout what do you think it could end up at ? There's not really any way to ""manage"" a losing long call If your bullish then buy the stock don?셳 buy the option then you can hold forever Cut your losses... or roll it way out and down radically and sell a call to create a spread. Personally I would cut your losses and spend the money elsewhere. If you dont want to go nvda perhaps start building a tsmc position? I have Sep 45$ call and down 65% , should I leave the ship or ride the earnings? I feel like ride the earnings given they received funds from Biden administration. NVDA Earnings Upside Coming but first an AMD Earnings Dip  SOXL (semi ETF) gains almost as much as NVDA from the start of 2023 until recentMarch, it goes to show that institutions rely too much on diversification . NVDA is the only real player in the AI semi space .  NVDA doesn't have any competition in the AI semi space . Even if the big tech companies develop their own AI chip, it will take years to develop . MSFT, META, and GOOGL have already tested some MI300X against NVDA solutions and likely found them inferior .  None of the big players are announcing big purchases of AMD MI300X . GOOGL outright said they won't offer any AMD server solutions in the AI space . META, MSFT, AMZN all have mentioned AMD as an ""alternative"" at best .  Lisa Su isn't that kind of CEO, looking for steady incremental growth in established markets . AMD has been focusing on gaining Intel's enterprise server share . NVDA has been laying the groundwork for AI for the last 6 years a completely new market opportunity . AMD is still trying to battle for 7-10% AI share .  NVDA will be at new all-time-highs after their earnings report in May, 1100-1200 could be the target this year . AMD is reporting earlier at the end of April and could pull down all semi's with it for a few days after it reports . Wallstreet wants AMD to come out and say they're gonna sell 6  NVDA 'maxed out' around $500 last year and then rocketed to 750 before they even reported Q4 '23 numbers . If institutions had been allowed to allocate more to NVDA last year, then it would've run up to that number in 2023 . After this Earnings season, i think institutions will look at the numbers Good analysis, appreciate the effort. I agree with almost all of what you said. Nvidia has great leadership, lots of cash to keep investing and maintaining their moat, excellent record on execution, cuda ecosystem, etc. I too am in for the long term. Ultimately I think the other big ?쐄renemies??(as Steve Jobs called them) like MSFT, Amazon, Google do not like their over dependence on Nvidia. They too have billions to invest and are doing so. I give it 3-5 years until they have serious competition. I remember Nokia in the early 2000?셲, they had 80-90 % market share with their mobile phone. Then Apple came along with the smartphone and it turned the world on its head, at least in that market. I am cautious about very long term projections on price, etc as nature abhors a straight line projection. Who could have predicted a 10% drop last Friday - but I see that as a healthy counter to irrational exuberance of late in the market. For now I?셫 all in.  If history repeats then NVDA likely finds a top in the second half of next year and then starts a longer correction . The degree of those run-ups in the past were correlated to far less relative EPS growth than what NVDA is showing now though . I also think in general, that the AI boom will last about 4-5 years and  AMD tends to just make everything Open Source, which is morally admirable, but lazy in the innovation department . NVDA makes more specialized hardware to work exceedingly well with their dominant software . AAPL created an ecosystem with tight software / hardware integration .  NVDA can make lots of chips work at the same time with 100 TB/s of bandwidth per rack . Meanwhile, AMD has to use PCIe and Ethernet to scaleout their clusters . Ultra Ethernet just recently formed a group to plan the spec . I hold both NVDA and AMD. I recall very clearly Lisa had mentioned that later half of the year will see big rev jump and more sales. She has been very clear kn almost all ER/Analyst Q&A. AMD might drop this time but Lisa has been mostly right, under promises and over delivers. I wont be surprised to see AMD jumping maybe next qtr.  AMD is stuck in the ""domain"" where its not about chips anymore and not even the low level SW . Getting the chips + a good SW to effeciently use that chip is already a huge task and this is where AMD is currently stuck . Getting everything in place CPU + GPU + moving data around is a monumental task . Most people think that companies like MSFT will just recruite thousands of HW Engineers, lock them in a room and voila get a competitive product... if that was the case no one would pay $$$ for NV to do it.  NV is moving forward even faster where they try to build more effecient and domain specific solutions(like for medecine, biology etc...) this will create even bigger gaps as now AMD for example not only do they need to have a good low level SW for their chips but also build and integrate good systems . AMD is still struggling to even i saw an article that Nvidia HW engineers are worth $10 million on average (due to stock holdings and income). Pretty high price to entice them out of their jobs right now.  Say the market for AI goes to 225B/y and Nvidia has 90pct share - so Nvidia revenues are 200B and profits are 100B . At a PE of 30, Nvidia is a 3T value company - about 50pct higher than here . This could happen sometime in 2026 - they will probably be at a 40B The rest of the companies will fight for that 10pct share. Amd will get a few crumbs - but that could be enough to move their stock significantly. But the big question for Nvidia is whether the market keeps growing. I think it will. This is a paradigm change! I wish the stock falls to 620 and gives us a chance to back up the truck and load up! But it won?셳! the only real competitor to NVDA is AMD. Stock spilt coming.. nice write up, good reading thanks It?셲 forward PE that matters. NVDA forward pe = 34 AMD forward pe = 46 ouch for AMD Over 100 It is not a condition that the 23rd largest memory semiconductor company is established based on a beauty market with better stock pricesCoria is a crime that the No 1 market capitalization is a crime It feels like its right for no reason TSMC?셲 debacle in the American desert But in Taiwan, they definitely have that support somewhere in their megafab, whichever campus you are talking about. Do they have it yet in Phoenix, for every toolset? Yeah, it's not like 24/7 on call jobs are unusual in the US tech industry. If <pick big site of your choice> goes down at 2am, it gets addressed immediately, not the next morning. I suspect part of the disconnect in this case is TSMC managers have come to expect 24/7 response even if business needs don't necessarily require it. TSMC is speaking about it's own experience at the Washington fab. This isn't their first go at a fab in the US. Their last attempt, WaferTech, had similar issues and they never fully developed the site. How did they not learn from that and come into this with a better plan?  TSMC management probably doesn't actually care that much if the US fabs succeed . They're doing this because the Taiwanese and US governments are pressuring them to and (mainly) because the US government dropped billions of dollars worth of subsidies in their lap . Their attempts via WaferTech were made in the 1990s and early 2000s. I would venture to guess that almost nobody that worked through that endeavor is still at TSMC. That is why they didn?셳 learn from those mistakes. It?셲 already a costly endeavor to have a fab in the US, much more costly than it would be in Taiwan. After decades of success in Taiwan, TSMC knows what works for them. They would rather have the US adapt to their way of doing things than the other way around. And I?셫 not sure you can blame them either. What?셲 unfortunate is the culture clash we are seeing. That should alleviate itself going forward as US employees pick up on the standards being taught by the Taiwanese employees.  The US government doesn't cover all the cost of building these fabs, so TSMC would still lose alot of money if this didn't pan out . Sound like TSMC have fell for the FOMO mentality. They fear Intel and Samsung could outcompete them with American subsidies .  If you see the US making moves to diversify their supply chains, you would want to start preparing for the possibility that the US might at some point start to favour locally produced chips . Better to put up a token fab and show that you?Â™e making an effort, than to have it shoved down your throat later . the young American engineer had been eager for a stable, high-paying job in the semiconductor industry. Then, in late 2020, he received a LinkedIn message from a recruiter for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Bruce read up on TSMC ??the leading global manufacturer of advanced chips ??and got excited. Ah yes, he surely had to read up on tsmc and never heard of them before lol Tl;Dr It's entirely due to incompetent leadership on the TMSC's side and crazy work expectations, like that of the railroad, but from highly educated engineers instead. Except those expectations aren't considered crazy in Asia. Obviously whether these expectations are crazy or sane is relative, but the objective fact is Asian workers are harder working, more dedicated and paid less. The economics of building and operating fabs in the US is simply not there given this issue (along with many others like regulations and logistics). If US wants back it's manufacturing jobs back these things are inevitable and this is what you get. I worked with a Tier 1 automotive suppliers from China and their output is 1.5x of US suppliers and fastest turnaround for contracts to SOP. Not sure why people give it a big deal. First there's Fuyao Glass in Netflix' documentary American Factory and there's Giga factory where engineers are required to sleep on the production line.

2024-04-24," Business Wire: ""TSMC Celebrates 30th North America Technology Symposium with Innovations Powering AI with Silicon 1.07-1.10x density improvement? Hope 14A has a big jump over N3. Even though the performance specifications of the newly announced A16 node are rather low, the most interesting aspect within this symposium is the mention of a package integrated photonics called the Compact Universal Photonic Engine. The use of package integrated photonics could open up an entirely new paradigm for reducing the amount of energy involved in transmitting data across a chip. In particular with the increasing concerns of power consumption associated with larger packages. Photonics would be for off-package communication, at least through the end of the decade. The days of 100% improvements have been over for quite a while, and will never return. There are fundamental physics reasons for why it gets harder and harder to shrink. ASML approves Christophe Fouquet as CEO at annual meeting These companies already have PEs that factor in decades worth of growth Earnings is completely irrelevant when PEs are as high as they are INTC vs TSLA - Trying to understand market sentiment. Forgive my naive question but I'm really trying to wrap my head around these two stocks (stockholder in both).  INTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse. Still has a majority in data center and pc CPU space . Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track .  EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war . TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim . FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks . Can anyone explain why is the market so bullish about TSLA even after reporting lower EPS, 9% drop in revenue, and is ready to eat his words about the cheaper model like its God's truth itself, while INTC drops like a rock on the first opportunity, even though Semiconductors are the bedrock of AI and EV growth. I personally am a big believer in Intel. Not right now but in ten years I think they will be extremely competitive with TSMC. It takes many years to see results in their industry and Gelsinger is making all the right moves. They?셱e inching into the GPU space with powerful cards coming out this fall. Intel was also the first company to purchase a few of ASML?셲 latest lithography machines and they?셱e only just now receiving them.  If (big if) they can get their fabs up and running without any more significant delays and keep buying cutting edge manufacturing equipment, I see no reason why they won?셳 be competitive with TSMC by 2030 . The only question is if you?Â�e willing to park some of your money with them for a few years I also think INTC has the potential to be as competitive as TSMC by 2030 but the biggest issue is that they will be their biggest customer. So even if IFS could earn $50B a year, if 70% of its clients are INTC itself, it only leaves $15B available for external clients. This will mean that TSMC won't feel as threatened. This is great for INTC chip design but I don't feel comfortable staying with x86 designs when the future is clearly shifting towards ARM / RISC-V and GPUs. It remains to be seen how competitive Gaudi 3 is with NVDA and whether their open-sourced libraries can break CUDA's dominance.  18a is their next milestone. 2026 is when their high na machine that was just delivered will start churning out products. Low volume at first but will ramp up significantly. Backside power delivery, feveros and much more will have them extremely competitive again . Totally agree with your point. No matter if you like Intel or not, imagine if China takes over Taiwan and TSMC. They would control pretty much the whole chip market. We need Intel to step up and provide an alternative. I'm not gonna read all of that, but in the case of TSLA, I really think it was just as simple as it was recently pounded hard, and you have a CEO desperate to get the comp package, so he reran all the best hits from TSLA analyst day last year. TSLA's up move just isn't noteworthy for me yet. If it can get over $180 and sustain, it'll be more noteworthy. NVDA, AMD, and TSMC could all go bankrupt tomorrow and INTC still would drop. Interesting first sentence about each. ""INTC - Semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse."" vs ""TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim."" INTC: Let's wait 24 hours.. Results will be out tomorrow. Let's speak then! Also an INTC shareholder here and a big fan of #2 companies - that often trade at cheap valuations than the overhyped #1 market leaders. I'm looking at you - AMD. TSLA: unless they now come up with self driving revolution, legacy car manufacturers (VW, BMW, Mercedes) are stealing the cake. When they are quoting 6-8 PE and high dividend yields, I don't know why anyone would price TSLA at 30 PE TSLA, its TTM P/E is 70+ now (NB: TTM EPS is 2.22 after adjustment) Is it that bad at TSMC compared to Samsung and Intel? Duh. This is true for every company who took manufacturing from the west. They got the job because they pay less and have lower standards. Well, I guess everything depends on what exactly you mean by ?쐓tandard?? TSMC, as well as many other Asian companies, delivers high quality to its customers. Sometimes even higher than western companies. But often this is achieved at the expense of employees. Can't speak for Intel but the difference is noticeable for sure with the other two. I was told that Samsung was once like this in its beginning stages though, but eventually American management took over. Culture clash is very real, no one should be surprised Samsung definitely treats their workers a lot better than most corporate jobs depending on the role, but they are still unfortunately letting go of people just like a lot of the tech industry I?셫 pretty sure, especially people they feel are overpaid. South Korea still has enough bite to make American management follow their plans. I guess this is TSMC's ""competitive advantage"". Working for a new startup fab is going is always going to be a grind. Working for a TSMC startup fab must be unbearable. Yes. https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/s/PBvlyS4HJs Go read the reviews on Glassdoor for the Phoenix fab. It seems to be pretty bad over there. Some even allege that deaths have happened during construction. https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TSMC-Arizona-Reviews-EI_IE4130.0,4_IL.5,12_IS483.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng&filter.employmentStatus=REGULAR&filter.employmentStatus=PART_TIME ASML is #1 employer in The Netherlands, and standards are really good. TSMC (especially fabs) is notoriously known for its bad WLB even in Taiwan. The nature of this industry makes irregular work hours inevitable. Not trying to encourage this kind of behavior, but I don?셳 think one can become the best semiconductor foundry in the world by coasting tbh. We cant compete with 996 or similar work schedules Turns out America is also not a hit with American hires Would not expect less but I believe US laws and a couple of lawsuits will whip them into compliance. Is that plant up and running? Feel like the chips act just passed in my old body Welcome to the land of labor laws and unions That?셲 why they picked AZ, workers??compensation laws are not as friendly as other states. Seems like everyday there?셲 a post regarding TSMC or Samsung fabs regarding working culture are too hard, too much grind etc. I wasn?셳 alive at the time but this reminds me of when Japanese automakers first setting up manufacturing in the US. It was filled with similar complaints, worries and distastefulness. I think the movie ?쏥ung Ho??in 1986 was about the topic. Of the biggest semiconductor companies. The biggest and most known are TSMC, Intel and Samsung. All of them have terrible work-life- balance compared to other industries due to the nature of foundry and Fabs.  Intel has more accepted working culture in the US compared to Asian fabs . Intel work much more closely with tooling, jig suppliers and suppliers??engineers . TSMC and Samsung focus on learning all they can about the jig, tooling and modify to suit their needs . That alone put much more pressure on their in-house engineers but it also ensures they can get have faster repairs instead of waiting for equipment suppliers engineers when something is out of commission. The working culture difference is not likely to be resolved in the near future and the WLB will eventually gotten worse overtime with all the 3 big companies in competition with each other as all of them head hunts each other?셲 talents. However, if someone new to the industry and accepted by one of those 3. I?셝 say go for it. It will look amazing on your resume and will have easier time to jump ship and career advancements. If someone got offer in all 3 companies that?셲 where you choose from whichever culture suits you the best. There are whole bunch smaller companies you can work for with much better WLB and that is always an option. If you decided to work with either of the Asian Fabs. Understand that the cultural is hard and your foreign colleagues are extremely prideful about their position in those companies. So your person work ethic will be compared to those type of employees. Good luck! I hope you future success in whichever company or field you choose. Sale issue If youre going to drop 5 why did you increase 8 percent yesterday Semiconductors - cyclical - how to track/rotate? Your take on ASML Hi sorry for the poor title - couldn't come up with something better. Semiconductors are known for being cyclical, so I'm curious to hear your opinion on where we are right now in this cycle.  ASML has done well over the past year and it is up by a large % . However, based on latest earnings and a re-evaluation of its intrinsic value based on a DCF calculation, I see the stock currently being largely overvalued . With other words, the current numbers cannot justify the stock price . So I'm wondering if you've trimmed your semiconductor stocks with profit with the intention to buy back some shares when the price drops? Disclaimer: No one can predict the future, so the price never drop. But I think we can agree that the semiconductor stocks are over-extended right now :) I look forward to a fruitful discussion.  People who follow the semiconductor industry seem to think we're still in the beginning or middle stages of the up cycle . It only looks like a peak due to AI, which is tangentially related . We've only reached a point where supply can't meet demand in AI GPUs . This is the answer. AI's explosive demand has people missing the fact that the majority of semiconductor end markets are much closer to their bottoms than their top.  The demand for AI compute will only increase and rapidly . As the models get more useful and get it to the AGI range the big tech will start eating up the economy at a rapid pace . The AI hype has lasted less than a year. I think a lot more AI news will be coming out the next couple of years, even if nothing in the end happens, the stocks will be driven by sentiment. ASML is certainly overvalued looking at pure numbers, but their services are growing fast, they have a huge moat and are extremely critical for the development of the world. It deserves a premium and my feeling is it will go higher the next couple of years based on sentiment alone. If you actually googled ""where semiconductor cycle"" its everything you asked for  I don't know where we are in the cycle, but I do think that the A.I. hype has driven the price up more than would be reasonably justified . Personally (and wtf do I know) I wouldn't sell, because as you said it's a great company, and also like you said, no one can predict the As far as I know, the two have no competitors. Yes, there are other companies doing (trying to) what they do.. but simply aren't there yet. They are like Google at the IPO time. Or, Intel of 1990s. Market leaders - and no one to challenge. Is the current ridiculous valuation justified? Why not. Keep it to 5% of your total portfolio. AVGO... plenty of room to go! I hate that I agree with this. I bought it at 400 and sold at 600 thinking I'd get a chance to get back in... haven't gotten back in since. Big lesson learned. I should have known better, especially with a company like Broadcom - an absolute beast in so many respects. Got in on the Marvell party though!  ASML guided FY flatish in January and the stock then proceeded to go up 46% by the beginning of March . The decline recently to me feels like a reset for a name that was ahead of itself . Will 2025 be better? Sure, perhaps .  The company has already stated that the growth for 2024 will not keep up with the past years, expecting a new ramp up in 2025 . I'm holding for some time now and will continue to hold. Of course I could have sold and waited expecting them to fall, but the whole market is so driven by hype .  Semi cycle for many companies is just beginning the upswing, others haven't even started it yet . A ton of demand for certain chips have been pulled forward a great deal because of AI, so we'll see how that plays out .  semicap companies will be the first to fall when the downcycle comes or even before then . I think they're the most vulnerable at the top this cycle, because so much of that equipment ordered to fulfill AI demand will be used to meet upcoming demand for more general-purpose chips . Long story short, I'm buying those that are beginning to show Q/Q order growth after a historic downturn. I'm less certain that semicap will have the same runway this cycle from here because AI demand pulling forward so many orders so early in the cycle.  AMD had 5 weeks that were down in the last 2 months . That's a huge warning sign . AMD didn't put up any support around 180. That should've been a clear sign to sell . Have you at least withdrawn your initial investment, if you're up significantly?  About to crash/crashing TSMC says 'A16' chipmaking technology will start production in late 2026 Are they renaming N2P to A16? A16 seems to be the node after N2P, from TSMC's press release. TSMC's press release: TSMC Celebrates 30th North America Technology Symposium with Innovations Powering AI with Silicon Leadership | Business Wire  TSMC A16 Technology: With TSMC?Â�� industry-leading N3E technology now in production, and N2 on track for production in the second half of 2025, TSMC debuted A16, the next technology on its roadmap . A16 will combine TSMC's Super Power Rail architecture with its nanosheet transistors  TSMC NanoFlex provides designers with flexibility in N2 standard cells, the basic building blocks of chip design . Customers are able to optimize the combination of short and tall cells within the same design block, tuning their designs to reach the optimal power, performance, and area tradeoffs . 1.07-1.10x density improvement? Hope 14A has a big jump over N3. 14A will be high-NA EUV while A16 isn't. Guess we'll see if it's really worth it. Looks to be for HPC only and not low power mobile? This naming is confusing. I thought iPhone SoCs were getting delayed by a lot. Personally, I don't believe it. Even if they have a few test chips we already know Fab 52 won't be ready for volume production this year. The thing is that the whole ""X nm"" thing is just marketing. A node is just more than one dimension of a transistor, not to talk that it isn't even ""2nm"", but more like 30 or so? So, unless we port the same chip from one node to the other and we start doing testing, this is just speculation TSMC says A16 chipmaking tech to arrive in 2026 setting up showdown with Intel The AI has spread across Atlantic ocean Join WSB Discord Surprisingly TSM stock price has actually gone up in response to this news No fucking idea how Intel has been late and their node process for chips hasnt evolved that much I still bet on Intel long term since the CHIPS act but the other dayweek when WSB was losing its ass on calls decided it was probably hopefully near the bottom and bought in The A16 stuff is actually good news the showdown with intel is just editorializing where there is no actual real competition yet Pretty sure over half of this sub wanted china to invade Taiwan over the last month and half bUt tHe gEoPoLiTiCaL RiSkS I bought 2 shares of TSM recently I doubt China wants to totally fuck the world over with a fullscale invasion they would be hurting the global economy on an absurd scale that only damages business and progress for everyone You could argue they are that desperate to gain and hold the lead over Western tech but it would only expedite local investment and divert talent No more good news We need bad news for TSM for its price to go up Analysts told Reuters that the technologies announced on Wednesday could call into question Intels claims in February that it will overtake TSMC in making the worlds fastest computing chips with a new technology Intel calls 14A Kevin Zhang TSMCs senior vice president of business development told reporters that the company has developed its new A16 chipmaking process faster than expected because of demand from AI chip firms without naming specific customers AI chip firms really want to optimize their designs to get every ounce of performance we have Zhang said Zhang said that TSMC does not believe it needs to use a ASMLs ASMLAS opens new tab new High NA EUV lithography tool machines to build the A16 chips Intel last week revealed that it plans to be the first to use the machines which can cost 373 million each to develop its 14A chip TSMC also revealed a new technology for suppling power to computer chips from the backside of the chip which helps speed up AI chips and will be available in 2026 TSMC does not believe it needs to use a ASMLs ASMLAS opens new tab new High NA EUV lithography tool lol at least a person wrote this Woah A16 higher than 14A TSMC must be better chip higher integer label TSM to the moooon Call me regarded but I confident my 145 calls will hit by mid next month I have until June before my fate is sealed though yes they did did you sell Intel never had a prayer at regaining technical leadership ChadSMCs roadmap is just executing too well The door is shut on Big Blue through about 2030 But maybe if theyre nice TSMC will fab a few more Core I7s for them Tim Apple TSMC unveils 1.6nm process technology with backside power delivery, rivals Intel's competing design They Target H2 2026. while Intel targets H2 2025-H1 2026 ? Did I get that right? What is your opinion on 16A vs Intel 14A? Do we have information which one will take the lead? Without them actually making them at scale yet, we don't know who is taking the lead. You can do almost anything you want in a lab. Can you do it cost effectively is the main question. Intel and TSMC mean VERY different things by ""ready"" TSMC means the production fabs are ramping up and products will be in stores in 6 months. Intel means they have a working test sample at an R&D fab and maybe you'll see it in a product 18 months from now. I do think it is funny how little they care about the term ""2 nm"" or ""1.6 nm."" They are advertising a 1.1x transistor density bump from 2 nm. Which would actually be ~1.95 nm. I know this is all a marketing term and it doesn't map onto anything, but I thought they would try to make the generational leaps follow a pattern.  Intel's N7 had 36nm fin widths and 54nm gate pitches or something like that . I don't think they really follow anything anymore. I still see people asking ""what happens after 1nm?""  Intel is delaying BPD even further while changing node naming to make it look good . Previously they claimed BPD will be introduced with N2P, now it's A16 . So instead of being 1 year behind Intel (in terms of introducing BPD) they will be 2 years behind . They are not only delaying BPD, they have secretely delayed their entire N2 line. I remember in one of their press conferences, one year after they first announced it, they were boasting how they would have reached 90% yield rates by 2024 with mass production likely coming that same year. Fast forward today, and we won't see products not earlier than 2026. I believe it was N2 that was supposed to feature GAAFET and BPD. Sounds a lot like A16 is what N2 was originally supposed to be. Maybe I'm misremembering but wasn't there supposed to be a large density jump between the combination of GAA and BPD? GAA isn't a density thing. You can play around with things by making the sheets wider instead of having to drop in a whole new fin, but I don't think I've seen any density numbers thrown around. It's big for power efficiency/leakage, though. If Nvidia GPU are to use this years later, I wonder if we can get mainstream $300 GPU at RTX4090 speed. In 8 years or so maybe you will have a 4090 equivalent GPU at low costs. This 1.6nm has less improvement compared to 5nm than the Intel 10nm compared to Intel4 Aww another reason to regret not buying TSMC stocks... You do realize you are making Intel look bad with your trolling? If that is your goal, then good job. Also, TSM is on a foreign exchange with heavy government oversight and will behave differently from domestic stocks. Difficult to compare. UMCs betterthanexpected Q1 results prompt Citi to upgrade stock to buy No wonder giving the bad utilation rates at Intels fabs on matureolder nodes Even if they had to sell their capacities under value its still better than having them on just 50 utilization rates But still the question emerges What is their anwer on heavy buildup overcapacities especially in asia cheap much more price competitive but also worldwide in general IFSs dilemma Thus competing on mature nodes is a fight you cant really win and on potentially lucrative leadingedge nodes they are far away  from being able to supply themselves How are they supposed to supply any serious quantities to external customers Thus IFS cant really be a margin maker The best IFS can do is trying to at least raise utlization rates to lower operating margin losses However they still need other succesfull branches to raise GM at least Trading own fabbed products versus producing products for external customers would cause a huge margin bleed 60 gt 515 United Microelectronics reports inline first quarter wafer shipments increased 45 Anyone suckered into buying nvda or amd are just plain dumb and not thinking clearly analyst claiming that it may not effect these stocks are just plain LYING to try and save the outfall from all this 72 is worse than any earth quake in the last 50 yrs in Taiwan",0

buying an iPhone again It does generally map to transistor density albeit with different mappings across foundries but its a departure from when we used to talk about node size as the transistor gate length Gory detail httpsenwikichiporgwikitechnologynode oh my god the crazy lads did it 16nm is NUTS If we get to a 5nm chip we have to start seeing some moores law failures No we should go below 0

TBW warranty limitations and perhaps other companies are also hiding that TBW limitation from consumers but Crucial Micron is I suggest the US customers report a complaint to httpsreportfraudftcgov Specifically because their marketing materials reference a limited warranty with a footnote That footnote then details that its limited by the TBW  published in the product datasheet However the product datasheets dont seem to be publicly available in any reasonable location The crucial chat agent also said they were not publicly available but offered to email me them as requested I am of the opinion that if a document is going to be incorporated by reference into the terms and conditions of a warranty then that document needs to be clear concise and certainly publicly available within a few links of the marketing materials referencing it A consumer needs to be able to compare prospective purchases on identical terms and especially if they elect to make a purchase they should have the fine print presented to them clearly which is certainly not the case here So if youre in the United States please file a complaint as such with the FTC I suggest the US parties report a complaint to httpsreportfraudftcgov OP on Crucials site search for whichever models support page in the search box Example type in T700 support and choose the page suggestion when it appears When the support page loads scroll down to the driver section and below the driver youll find the datasheet link Tap on it The PDF page that loads contains the word flyer in the filename yes but the link you tap to get to said page is labeled datasheet Ignore the PDF name The user facing link is labeled appropriately for the legal footnote If you go to Samsungs site their datasheets are formatted in a very similar fashion and so yes the flyer as the Crucial PDF is named is in fact the datasheet It is right here I found it on my phone in a minute Found the Micron one on my phone in a minute too Seems like OP is really stretching here But even there in the product flyer in the bottom they also then reference a product datasheet in the footnotes 10 This is still marketing materials and not necessarily the document referenced by the legalese at the bottom Its not different then if I advertised a car with a 10 year warranty  and in the fine print I said 10 year warranty or some number of miles disclosed elsewhere Sure you might be able to make some argument with the tech support during a warranty RMA but why should you have to All the terms and conditions should be readily available and in clear and unambiguous language Why not just purchase SSDs from a company thats transparent about their product warranty Because it might be a worse deal Huh The TBW for that model is just listed with the other product info where I live Is it listed on a document or page called Product data sheet or a marketing flyer Im not able to edit the original post for some reason but uBlu3iris sorted it out

reference card which was experiencing the faulty vapor chamber issue It turned out to be a good purchase as it is quiet and tops out at around 63 edge and 80 junction which is better than most I am curious about what they would do if I needed to RMA it since they no longer produce them Removed is a weird way to word that they stopped making AMD cards likely of their own volition If sales numbers are any indication they likely decided to just focus on Nvidia cards instead Sales of the 7000 generation were not that bad and AMD partners are allowed to have higher margins compared to what Nvidia allows them to do it certainly didnt raise the bar but many of the GPUs sold wellish i would suspect it has more to do with their partnership with Nvidia not the actual sales thats sad i used an msi rx580 for years it was lovely Well thats interesting Anyone have any ideas They focus on Geforce Addition to uJhawk163 and the others here MSI actively put AMD in much worse laptop chassis Worse chassis worse thermal paste Just one most recent example If you are active in gaming laptop space you would know that MSI have a reputation for having the worse hinges ever there is currently a class action lawsuit forming up However since last year 2023  high end GP and GE series hinges are finally updated  they now copy ROG Strix series hinges  just google it and you will see the uncanny copy and paste job here  no one else does the jarring exposed style of hinges and even the geometry looks exactly the same And guess what happened to the top end AMD gaming laptop from MSI of 2023 the MSI Alpha 17 Your thoughts is the same as mine instead of sharing the new GP chassis it used the old 2022 GP chassis with the bad hinge Now of course because AMD isnt the most popular so many brands dont put as much or really little AMD in their lineup but most brands at least try or not compromise AMD so much and so balatantly Good nice riddance They actively took off cooling elements on Radeons since years compared to Nvidia cards RX6000 Gen best example Removed the fuckin coldplate on Radeon and only had pure heatpipe contact where out of the 8 fuckin pipes only 23 had contact New entry How

power delivery rivals Intels competing design  Toms Hardware For comparison the newly announced Blackwell B100 from Nvidia uses TSMCs 5nm nodes so even if theres no architectural improvements hardware will continue to improve exponentially for the next few years at least 2025 Blackwell 5nm 2027 3nm 2029 16 nm Seems we are good this decade in terms of moores law Post 2030 Im sure we can find ways to use agi to make further progress The names of nodes dont mean what they sound like The sizes are just marketing terms and not actual sizes PHOTONIC CIRCUITS ARE GOING TO BE SUPER SUPER SUPER FAST We arent  those numbers literally do not mean anything They are just marketing terms Node side stopped going down relative to transistor sizedensity like that a decade ago Yes there are some improvements happening  mostly around chip architecture rather than substantial advancements at the level of the material construction itself Honest question Can technology go subnanometer I was under the impression that would be a hard limit Does tech necessarily go quantum at that point for further significant gains We already encountered severe effects from quantum tunnelling We had to switch to a new technology for the transistors FINFET I believe which are laid vertically and look like a shark fin The whole article is actually deciding which is the better approach Both Intel and TSMC use UV light to mark the transistors on the silicon however Intel has brought the new more advanced machine It uses a wider aperture for the UV light allowing smaller features on a single pattern TSMC is going to use a technique called double patterning which involves exposing to the UV light twice but takes more time and can have higher failure rates You can even do triple patterning with more of the issues Intel will be able to do these new sizes faster and could later do double and triple patterning giving them possibility of even smaller sizes Finally the manufacturer of these machines is working on a machine with an even wider aperture which will allow considerably smaller features and ultimately double and triple patterning will be possible on those getting us quite far in the Moores law pathway Note I have simplified for brevity but hopefully have conveyed the gist of it Its just marketing hogwash These nm names have nothing to do anymore with any physical sizes Stopped that a few generations ago For example 5 nm node is expected to have a contacted gate pitch of 51 nanometers and a tightest metal pitch of 30 nanometers there are other ways to increase compute power ie graphene chips that will allow for terahertz clock speeds with much lower power consumption at the same time httpswwwnewscientistcomarticle2410612firstworkinggraphenesemiconductorcouldleadtofastercomputers We already get quantum effects at the 5nm level and they are becoming increasingly pronounced as we continue to miniaturize Right now we primarily try to mitigate these effects but exploring materials with unique quantum properties such as topological insulators or superconductors could lead to large improvements even without subnanometer miniaturization Unfortunately these sizes are marketing terms only They have 0 correspondence to the size of the transistors at all They stopped comparing them to real transistor size a decade ago 5nm is like a small at McDonalds Its just whatever size they sell with that label There are a few material improvements we might be able to make at the nano level to genuinely get a bit smaller but we are definitely nearing physical limits of what we can accomplish with technology on silicon Other materials are being researched still and in the mean time physical transistor designs are being improved materially where possible in silicon as well as larger scale chip architectures Implications 05nm lets go This is a buying opportunity for INTC Intc is down over 10 today on news that should have been fairly expected They have been cleaning up a mess for the past couple years and it takes a lot of time to right the ship They made a good move massively cutting their dividend and will benefit from the CHIPs act and likely future government investments to come But all of this takes time So the current earnings reports are still suffering and all tailwinds and future benefits In my opinion this creates a strong buying opportunity Disagree Intel will eventually recover but who knows how far down the line that is Theye losing market share and really only surviving on government bailout money Supply constraints will allow some money to trickle down as consumers have to settle for alternatives but they have a lot of issues that will take a lot of money and time to solve My other fundamental issue is how much they are struggling to retain talent or even attract good talent Nobody with good talent wants to stay there as all big companies are throwing billions on chip design paying like 34x what intel pays Intel has been raided completely by the big companies like Nvidia Apple Google Amazon Microsoft Meta for all of its talent Nobody wants to work at intel when they can work at these companies and make 3 times the money I don know how they get around it Meta alone is expected to spend 40 billion in AI Capex this year That like 3x intel total RD budget Intel is uninvestable until they can demonstrate they can gain enough customers to fill up their fabs and operate at a profit Its no great achievement to build product comparable to TSMC while running massive losses The overhead costs of those fabs will bury Intel if it doesnt go perfectly Even if it does go perfectly there is a cap on future earnings as competition will prevent them from raising margins beyond a certain point I like the negativity on this thread though Excellent Time to buy Intels US manufacturing Vs 100 Taiwan NVDA for example Trading below BV25 and with 6 per sh In cash Intel is a no brainer Once you see extreme cheerleading its time to bail out But thats just me  Feel like the capital can be better put elsewhere until INTC proves that it has numbers and strength Catching a knife isn ideal INTC should have been moving with the market as we moved upward but it did not I agree with OP for similar reasons The fact that reddit by and large dislikes INTC also suggests that it is also a good buying opportunity Obligatory insert IASIP  can go lowermeme here So I bought last year back when the price was in the 2030 range I wasnt really expecting the pop that happened this year though it looked like it would grow a bit Its more of a long term holding for me I dont think anyone needs to rush into a position now I honestly wasnt expecting anything from it until 2025 Theres a lot of work that goes into updating top end chip fabrication years and billions Semis are sort of cyclical from what I have seen invest in the next tech then run it as long as you can to profit Intel ran it too long this time trying to eek it out with dual patterning to skip EUV and paid the price when cutting corners didnt work out TSMC took the lead there Interestingly it might be TSMC now making the same mistake Claiming they dont need High NA EUV to stay competitive maybe this is just shareholder soothing IDK TLDR I think if intel can make it work they will reap the rewards its going to take time though probably more slow growth for a year or more No rush to buy for me but might as well hold unless I see something better A hell of a good buying opportunity  Got in  I tend to agree but I enjoy reading all the dissenting opinions I think the price reflects a good buying opportunity 04292024 AMD 250B market cap Nvidia  22T market cap Intel  140B market cap TSMC 620B market cap Samsung  310B market cap If Im going to buy one of these companies with the most upside over 510 years Im struggling to see how intel isnt a strong contender given the current price If Pat executes on his plan and becomes number 2 behind TSMC thats at least 2x upside and probably more These losses are heavily driven by RD This is the pain of their missteps Intel is in the situation its in because previous CEOs neglected EUV and other technological advances to preserve margins Now when theyre investing heavily to catch up the market is punishing them Intel will be the first to rollout High NA EUV Theyre going to be the first to do backside power delivery Theyre focusing heavily on being the innovator they once were before an MBA took over as CEO as opposed to an engineer like Pat I know there are many other metrics to look at other than market cap but at the current price it looks like there is at least a reasonable expectation of preserving your investment at this level and a solid chance at good upside if Pat executes and I might add theyve been executing so far on their plan The salesrevenueearnings just havent come yet Maybe it never will but I think its a good bet Looking at the 5 year average price it seems like INTC still has a bit of room to fall if it hits 25 Ill jump on it Lol thats what those smart kids did last year I think DCAing from now until rock bottom is the correct play Personally Im 5y long on INTC I use to think like that and bought under 40 right around when Pat became CEO But sold around the first quarter when their FCF went negative for a profit Was going for the long haul 510 year hold too They will probably never catch up to Samsung let alone TSMC They need new management not just CEO Like new board full new C suite like BA Boeing does too Need engineers Master and PhD holders in there Intel just got too complacent and used tactics to just keep drifting and not innovating Reason why AMD came back from 2 a share to now Reminds me of the stories you hear about Microsoft doing shady sales tactics against competitors Like Intel teaming with Dell and etc To keep AMD out TLDR Will they pull a GE or a MSFT with Satya replacing Ballmer Just buy SMH instead so you get diversification and a mix of winners and losers Intc is kind of of like Boeing My gut tells me they should be doing well but their management seems off and probably needs to go Pat as CEO is pretty good but Intel is in a very demanding sector and it got lazy under previous CEOs at the EXACT worst time Even if management does everything right and I do think they are seriously trying the company may be longterm doomed Lots of new competitors that have rapidly advancing and superior products in several product categories Nvidia ARM Cerberus an old rival that is gobbling up Intels core x86 server and desktop markets AMD and a supercompetent worldclass fab competitor TSMC along with several important hyper scale customers leaving past monopolies and making their own customized products Google Amazon Microsoft combined with a everslowing and dying Moores Law means that there are not a lot of chances for Intel to regain their crown and a awful lot of chances for Intel to just plain die a slow painful death over the next decade or two The previous Intel CEO Brian Kryzanich was a fing moron of the lowest order Bob Swan was not that much better OrIntel has been the canary in the coalmine more than once Harbinger of doom recession I give it 4040 at this point Buy INTC flip a coin Never try to catch a falling knife Sentiment too bearish I was bullish on them before they got decimated Still bullish I will top up shares when I get the chance  I care about their GPU lineup which will get the gaming revenue and hopefully it gets better to get the AI revenue Chips are transitioning to be able to run AI models so theyll get better there too Im disappointed in board of

2024-04-26,"ASML best long-term chip bet? Given how extremely overpriced stocks like Nvidia are, but AI is a very hot topic at the moment I started looking into possible other choices. One stock really jumped out: ASML. ASML?셲 revenue is forecast to grow significantly by 2025 and beyond. 2024 is a stagnant year mostly focusing on investments and waiting out the upgrade cycle. Plans to expand in Eindhoven and create an additional 20.000 jobs, which signifies the increase in workload in the future. AI is an extremely hot topic, with heavy investments on the horizon in the hardware to run this advanced software. These cutting-edge chips are only produced through ASML?셲 EUV technology. Recently had a significant price drop because lots of investors got spooked from the cyclical nature of the chip industry and thought one bad earnings call meant the company is declining. Am I missing something or is this stock underrated? Join WSB Discord Buy... while the plebs are distracted arguing about AI and while the stock is still somewhat affordable for the dwindling middle class. AVGO Indeed! It?셲 a great stock, I?셶e held some for probably a decade now. They will remain ahead of their competitors for the upcoming years. But it?셲 a long term stock play, not a short term options play with their cyclus involved. Maybe some leaps of you can afford them. Overpriced nvidia ??time to buy more It's recently dropped a bit, so probably a good time to buy (not do options). I picked up a few stocks last year at 735/sh and it reached 1000/sh a few months ago. It's a long term play of mine, so generally have been happy with my purchases. It's crazy how expensive a share is, however. I consider asml and tsm good long term pairings, but TSMs recent movements kinda sucked to witness. Not much growth in that part of the supply chain. It was a solid play months ago, but I think it might lack the explosiveness of NVDA going forward. I'm eyeing MU after SK Hynix beat earnings. Next Gen memory chips enable next Gen AI GPUs and MU is ahead of Hynix on that front, based on when the production lines got up to full capacity. ?쏥iven how extremely overpriced stocks like Nvidia are??$ASML NVDA Forward PE - 36 ASML Forward PE - 41 Congrats regard!

I?셫 going to preface this by saying that I?셫 fairly new to trading options. I?셶e dabbled in options before but it?셲 been unstructured, at best. I wanted to play INTC earnings but I didn?셳 want to guess the direction. I went long on the 33.5/36.5 strangle for $1.67. I looked at the IV for the 04/26 options and it was at ~140%. To counter the potential IV crush, I went long on the 05/03 strange instead, the IV for which was ~65%.  I decided the $3 width (equidistant from $35, which is where INTC was just before market close on 04/25) based on the at-the-money straddle which had a premium of $2.5 (which translated to an expected ~7.1% move) Looking at the last few earnings of IN My thought process on this position was that I would be closing out the trade the morning after earnings and not holding the week of expiry. So, according to my (likely flawed) analysis, I was only exposing myself to theta decay of one day on a flat earnings move if things went sour. Thankfully, INTC dropped about 8-8.5% on earnings and I was able to close out the strangle at $2.39. I?셫 looking for comments/critiques of my thought process and what I might not have accounted for so that I can keep getting better. Hoping to learn from the experts on here. Thanks in advance! This is the reason many do not trade earnings. Why did my options lose value when the stock price moved favorably? -- Options extrinsic and intrinsic value, an introduction https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value Thanks for that link. Even though I was familiar with the subject matter, it's always nice to clarify and refine one's understanding. Prosperous trades my friend. Why fight IV crush? Go with the higher probability trade and sell the inflated premium  What I do is sell an Iron condor with the wings set at expected move . Thus if (if, but probability is in my favor) the stock does not move more than that Expected move I can make a decent profit . I had a feeling that intc would be low, I've slowly been building up to 1 share. I don't normally fractional, but in this case I wanted to build up. Kept adding a couple bills here and there as it dropped down past 31. Hit the 30 dip and went in on full shares.   Intel has had a rough bout the last decade not having a lot to show while AMD has made huge strides . It's a long term hold though for sure, trying to use intc like nvda is literal gambling . Holding intc for the next 5-10 will be a good investment though IMO. And if you'd opted in back then, you'd be up like 100%. From memory I want to say AMD was ~$65 back then (March 2019 into Sept 2019).  Intel on the other hand had a steep slope IMO due to the same market circumstances, however they did NOT have themselves set up for continuing this growth. And we see where that led us, as they're now wavering between 30 and 33.  I think in a few years Intel will have something to show other than 6.0ghz single cores, and if not well, I only paid $30 a share lol My thought process on this position was that I would be closing out the trade the morning after earnings and not holding the week of expiry. So, according to my (likely flawed) analysis, I was only exposing myself to theta decay of one day It may only be one day of theta decay, but you will still suffer from IV collapse, even though your expiry is a week away. backtest many previous cycles of how this trade would have performed in the last 8 or 12 earnings. try it for different expiries try it with a straddle and strangle and compare the results compile a list of tickers which have often moved more than the expected move This way, you may be able to increase the probabilities slightly more in your favour. Thank you! Those are some concrete action items for me. Appreciate the guidance! Personally I would have chosen a directional play with defined risk and gone for the higher return. Overall it?셲 a nice trade through solid work I have been burned by directional plays in the past. Having said that, I?셶e most likely been ?쐅uessing??the direction and not basing the directional play off of any concrete thought process. Would you be open to sharing how you think someone could get better at directional plays? Nowhere in your post was an explanation of why you thought the option premium was too low. In AI we trust BofA remains bullish on these 5 chip stocks Why is the Barbie naked Tech sector Which stocks will dominate the market in May  Expert price targets pure advertising Thoughts on INTC for Wheel? INTC is a constant disappointment from a long term hold position, but what is the consensus on using INTC in a wheel strategy, or just selling put credit spreads? Stock goes down, premiums are usually abysmal. Where is profit? You should only be wheeling stocks that you have a long term conviction on. At some point you will get assigned, and it will become a long term hold (until it gets called away, obviously). The problem with INTC is.. it rarely gets called away, because it just keeps going down. You'll inevitably become a bagholder until it finds solid ground. You can run a PCS on it if you think in the short term it will hold at a level of support. But IMO, there are much better options out there for running put credit spreads on. INTC hasn't found support yet Yes, I think it's a good idea. INTC is heavily manipulated, but I think it's approaching a bottom. Insiders keep buying shares, which is unusual for any stock, let alone a tech company. The US government also seems to believe that Intel has some strategic or cultural importance. So I think the odds are in your favor for a put-selling strategy. Just don't try to chase the stock if it goes up too quickly. I love INTC cause it's getting beaten down so selling puts on it is easy money. Especially an American chips company, relatively low risk. Sold 31$ bullish put spreads and already green. Going to roll these as long as needed. Tell that to my $43 put I sold a few weeks ago ?쁻 now I am bag holding and selling puts under $30 Just come to the dark side and buy June $31 calls?삇  INTC i dont know where is the bottom and when it?셲 gonna bounce back but all i know is when you wheel a stock that means you won? https://www.threads.net/@keubikooriginal/post/C6Ohvu9OAoF/ Maybe enter with a put ratio spread so if you do get assigned at least you got a little more for it. And if you get assigned, collar the shares off so you are protected to the downside, but this stock is beat up pretty good already and will probably rally at some point bc senators own it or some bologna like that INTC going to have dead cat bounce, other then that I am bearish",2

Here are Samsung?셲 first-quarter results versus LSEG estimates: Revenue: 71.92 trillion Korean won (about $52.3 billion), vs. 71.04 trillion Korean won Operating profit: 6.61 trillion Korean won, vs. 5.94 trillion Korean won Samsung?셲 revenue for the quarter ending March jumped 12.81% from a year ago, while operating profit soared 932.8% in the same period. The figures were in line with the company?셲 guidance earlier this month, where Samsung said operating profit in the January-March quarter likely rose to 6.6 trillion Korean won, up 931% from a year ago. The firm expected first quarter revenue at 71 trillion won. The South Korean electronics giant saw record losses in 2023 as the industry reeled from a post-Covid slump in demand. ?쏷he company posted KRW 71.92 trillion in consolidated revenue on the back of strong sales of flagship Galaxy S24 smartphones and higher prices for memory semiconductors. Operating profit increased to KRW 6.61 trillion as the Memory Business returned to profit by addressing demand for high value-added products,??Samsung Electronics said in a statement on Tuesday. Citi analysts said they see upside for Samsung?셲 NAND flash memory business as a result of AI computing demand. In a note on April 5, they reiterated their ?쐀uy??rating on the firm with a target price of 120,000 won ??a 56% upside from the closing price of 76,700 won on Monday. NAND is another staple memory chip alongside DRAM. ?쏻e expect storage (HDD) to be the next bottleneck in AI computing, especially in AI training, and foresee Samsung Electronics to be one of the key beneficiaries of SSD demand momentum for AI training,??said the Citi analysts. Samsung is the world?셲 largest manufacturer of dynamic random-access memory chips (DRAM), which are commonly found in a wide range of consumer devices including smartphones and computers. Samsung said it expects the second quarter to be driven mostly by demand for generative AI, while mobile demand remains stable. Meanwhile, it expects PC demand to be impacted by slow seasonality, which could lead to customers adjusting inventories before new product launches in the second half of 2024. In a Tuesday earnings call, the firm warned of escalating geopolitical instability and continued cost hikes in major components, particularly memory. ?쏱rofitability in Q2 is expected to be down slightly compared to Q1 and Q3, which is when we released new flagship products this year. In response, we?셱e focusing on cost competitiveness throughout the R&D, manufacturing and sales processes to achieve solid profitability,??said Samsung, adding that it will continue to boost flagship sales through expansion of Galaxy AI. Memory business returns to profit Samsung said its semiconductor business logged a 1.91 trillion Korean won in operating profit in the first quarter, as compared to a loss of 4.58 trillion won in the same period a year ago and a loss of 2.18 trillion Korean won in the fourth quarter. ?쏻e assume the earnings surprise was driven by higher memory price hike on AI-driven strong upturn cycle. We anticipate the company will guide for positive memory market outlook and emphasize its readiness in AI era including HBM (12H HBM3E, HBM4) and foundry/packaging solution,??said SK Kim of Daiwa Capital Markets in emailed comments to CNBC on Monday, ahead of the earnings release. As AI models become more complex and datasets become larger, these models need memory chips with higher capacities and faster speeds to cater to these workloads. Kim said in an April 5 report he expects another price hike on memory chips to drive Samsung?셲 second-quarter earnings on the back of an AI boom and the earthquake in Taiwan. ?쏣specially, we expect more upside in prices resulting from the earthquake in Taiwan,??said Kim, adding that the earthquake in early April temporarily impacted TSMC?셲 and Micron?셲 production. To meet AI demand, Samsung said it started mass producing HBM3E 8H and V9 NAND in April. It plans to mass produce HBM3E 12H products and a 128GB product based on 1b nanometer 32GB DDR5 within the second quarter. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, the firm expects the operational environment to ?쐒emain positive with demand????bolstered by generative AI ??in the second half of the year. Samsung also said development of 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer processes is ?쐏rogressing smoothly.??Samsung kicked off mass production of 3-nanometer chips in 2022 and plans to start mass producing 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Galaxy S24 boost Strong sales of Samsung?셲 latest smartphone series Galaxy S24 helped to lift revenue and operating profit of the mobile business, the firm said. AI features on the S24 such as Circle to Search, Photo Assist and Live Translate were popular among customers, Samsung said. However, the firm warned that smartphone demand and shipments could decline in the second quarter because of seasonality. Growing competition Many countries in the world are racing to manufacture advanced semiconductors. Earlier this month, the Biden administration agreed to grant Samsung up to $6.4 billion of funding to create new manufacturing capacity to produce chips in Texas. Micron and TSMC are also poised to receive grants to boost chipmaking in the U.S. after decades of chip production moving to Asia. Samsung and TSMC are set to face competition from Japan?셲 Rapidus Corporation, which was recently granted $3.89 billion in additional subsidies from the Japanese government to mass produce 2-nanometer chips from 2027. There are rising concerns that Samsung Electronics risks losing its leading position to rivals like SK Hynix, the world?셲 no. 2 memory chip maker. SK Hynix on March 19 said it became the first in the industry to mass produce HBM3E, the next-generation of high bandwidth memory chips used in AI chipsets. SK Hynix is the primary supplier of HBM3 chips to Nvidia?셲 AI chipsets. Mehdi Hosseini, senior tech hardware analyst of Susquehanna International Group, pointed out in early April that Samsung used to be the market leader in memory, smartphones and display innovations. Now, Samsung is only ?쐀enefiting from the cycle recovery,??he added. In the first quarter, Samsung managed to regain the top spot in smartphone shipments after losing the crown to Apple in 2023, according to International Data Corp.

Literally worse than dog shit molded into a washer. The dryer was fine whatever, but both washers just rusted out nearly immediately. Appliances certainly die a lot.

Isn't intel the only one planning to build a TSMC and Samsung like chip factory in the USA and Europe or did I get something wrong? Dosslen't that also give them a lot of good points with the goverment? Also Nvidia leaving the gaming market when becoming an AI company dosen't that mean Intels new Arc could have an openning when it gets better in the next few generations? Or does Nvidia plan to stay in the gaming market just focus on the AI and I got that wrong? Also CPU battles are historicaly cyclical. AMD on top, Intel on top AMD on top, Intel on top, Now AMD, In 5 years?.. Also Pet Helsinger seema like a good CEO to me or did an I not informed well? He became CEO some 3 years ago if I remember correctly at the top of my mind? Dosen't that mean we should se reutrns in the next few years on his decisons?  Intel's old successes don't hold the company afloat anymore, especially after the previous 2 CEOs that screwed shit up . The foundry itself has yet to be profitable and has been a lengthy investment with not much return . Gelsinger is a man with an actual Tech/Engineering background and will hopefully steer the company out of rough waters into smooth Makes me wonder if they?셱e a buy right now. They?셱e spending most of their money on building new fabs, so the news is saying that Intel is losing billions. Building new fabs is good news and an investment, not losing money They have made a lot of investments to make up for the last CEO pretty much sitting around doing nothing. Gonna be awhile but it?셪l go back up eventually once they finish the foundations for those investments. Investors are on different time scales. For some, (maybe the majority) the past couple of years has been a good time to sell, as the fundamentals that's driven Intel's share price for so many years has changed dramatically. If you held intel up until the start of the 2020's, and suddenly they can't scale their performance anymore, competition has caught up and suppassed, chip supply turned into a rollercoaster ride, and now their primary consumers demand GPUs/AI compute above all else, something which intel can't yet supply? If I was a long term holder, I would have certainly started trimming my position. But as for myself, I see this as a buying opportunity since intel is a big enough company, that will continue to fulfill a demand for x86 that won't be going away anytime soon. They're hardly making any money. TSMC is also building one(or two?) Fabs in Phoenix. However that said I am bullish on Intel and bought in near the lows. I have increased the position a few times. But at this point I'm chilling until I see more. Sat on their laurels for 10-15 years while sabotaging competition like AMD and thought that?셝 be enough to keep first mover advantage. Fuck intc. Absent China invading Taiwan, intc will be in the dust bin of history in another decade or so Intel is fine, load up while it?셲 cheap because it won?셳 be in 5 years ?몟?샂",4

Also more details on dc gpu roadmap in the coming months where does it say 4 billion in the amd earnings report  also comments on a full Reference Architecture for AMD integrated AI systems including Pensando DPUs that plug into open source infrastructure standards of their partners The idea being that AMD can provide open source systems that rival NVDA closed systems that lock customer into one supplier Did some rough calculation and I think DC up 300M in Q2 200M from MI300x So here for mi300x we might be Q1 600M Q2 800M Q3 11b Q4 15b if the full year is only 4b Probably we will see 5 market share in Q4 assuming NVDA has 30bQ If the full year get eventually raised to 5b it would be even higher Client is also quite interesting Maybe 100M150M in Q2 The strength would continue to 2H Looks like Pat is having adoption trouble with their MTL platform Just too costly I guess interesting comment can you tell me what Pat is  Multiple Comments during QA stressing that mi300 sales are back half loaded with some growth in Q2 and significant ramp up in Q3 and Q4 No supply side constraints and strong demand side But not much clarity on why 4B revenue estimate from AI is not larger considering lack of constraints From Dr Su it seems theyre taking a slower approach during initial ramp working closely with partners to ensure mi300x systems are tuned for maximum performance and efficiency Intel cant make enough MTL for the demand which is kinda funny for how meh it is at this point in time AMD Reports First Quarter 2024 Financial Results AMD today announced revenue for the

income was 11 billion net income was 10 billion and diluted earnings per share was 062 AMD is such a confusing company It claims to have amazing growth by benefitting from AI but the total revenue growth is in the single digits and theres barely any profit completely different from NVDAwhat gives different segments embedded and gaming segments are down xilinx and consoles mainly which offset gains in DC CPU AI GPUs ramping but not anything like NVDA The vast majority of AMD and Intel sales come from CPUs which is currently a market at a real low point Things will pick up and both companys bottom line will improve a ton They dont even claim to have amazing growth they guided for 2 billion in revenue from AI products for 2024 Is this good or bad for the stock i cant tell anymore Cantell that easily But in general their guidance has been good Market is waiting for Powellmeeting hence plunge down This is all because of CPU slowdowns No ones really buying CPUs right now Same thing with Intel Things will pick up more once fed drops rates a bit and new generations of consumer CPUs come out Yah the 8950X is going to blow everyone away At amd mi300x is Amds 1 focus and most of the hyperscalers have systems where you can plug in a UBB board of 8Gpus of either h100 or mi300x UBB if you look it up is a standard way to sell GPUs The question is once they complete their POC and pilot how many of the mi300s will they buy vs h100 Also why is it cost is it to put pressure on Nvidia is it On the call she mentioned poc pilot and other stages for partners I am wondering if the partners have orders but are also playing hardball w both amd and Nvidia on future sales Also interesting she did not name the follow on chips plus I am wondering how much of her answers were tied to what partners wanted her to share Follow on chips and systems to mi300 are heavily based on hyperscaler demands and partnerships Cheap calls at open thanks IV crush AMDs Q1 Call the good bad  ugly Regarded WSB Community This is a post regarding AMDs call Revenue in Q1 slightly beat expectations so did EPS Margins are getting better All good execution The guidance is decent considering there are some BAD moving parts which Ill cover below Ill share the Good Bad  Ugly starting backwards The UGLY GAMING Gaming got killed in Q1 and will continue hurting Why PS5 pro preparing to launch this year so consumers hold purchases Gaming GPUs sell less due to new gaming architectures launching this year with RDNA4 being teased in Computex in 5 weeks This explains why gaming dropped by 48 and will continue dropping in Q2 However this is NOT a reason to be concerned because The Sony PS5 PRO will sell strong at launch and will likely be hard to buy as usual RDNA4 will sell STRONG as AMD will only target the midrange no highend this gen Gaming has low margins The BAD Supply constraints impacting MI300 During minute 38 of the call probably the most important item discussed while answering Vivek Aryas question Bank of America Dr Lisa Su explained that MI300 has more demand than supply also for Q2 In essence AMD cant sell enough due to supply constrains AMD expects supply to improve in the back half of the year which is why they raised the guidance for over 4bn sales up from 35bn However this is NOT a reason to be concerned because Demand exceeding supply means that the MI300 series is COMPETITIVE As supply improves so will sales explaining why MI300 is doing STRONG Supply will catchup with demand in 2024 making it possible to exceed the over 4bn figure The GOOD Data center GPUs CPUs and MARGINS The most profitable and KEY products are selling STRONG MI300 is a success and the ONLY reason why AMD didnt sell more was due to supply constraints Also Turin is sampling and the Data Center segment remains STRONG Growth of 80 year over year is impressive with STRONG double digit growth for 2024 guided Conclusion AMD is supply constrained on MI300 products but they were still able to compensate the gaming segment dropping 48 and also embedded dropping 46 It is likely that 227 is a ceiling that will take many months to break Also today was a BAD day for markets marking the close of the worst month of 2024 However guidance for MI300 sales is 2024 is up to over 4bn from 35bn I wouldve wanted to hear 5bn but Ill likely have to wait until the Q2 ER as supply improves The stock will likely bleed tomorrow but the core of AMDs thesis is still STRONG Join WSB Discord OP must have his life savings in AMD calls However this is NOT a reason to be concerned because I have calls Please dont sell anymore This is no time for AMD calls I dont know why anyone even tries Maybe Q1 2025 they will have some results and a big ramp trajectory to show for AI Theres no reason to think there could be a catalyst before then Embedded cyclical down now suffering from COVID double ordering overhang Probably recovery end of year Good business not exciting Gaming consoles cannot make the kind of profits AMD needs to grow into its market cap PC graphics are hopeless and they havent shown a willingness to do the massive investments needed to maybe compete with Nvidias healthy gaming business someday AMD has 0 market share in gaming laptops and thats half of the TAM Nvidia runs this segment and AMDs 10 market share has thrown it into a vicious cycle where customers wont buy it game developers wont thoroughly test and optimize for it AMD wont invest into it because the revenue isnt there Its bad bad bad Server CPUs suddenly its a slow growth business All big investment is going to AI instead AMDs big selling point is not doing more computing to make customers more money its telling customers to buy one chip to replace 2 or 3 of their old chips and save space and energy Good for customers but AMD is working their own way out of a job People have been dooming about ARM taking over for a decade but massive cloud platforms are all finally settling on ordering custom chips for large parts of their spend AMD has great products here but its not going to bring disruptive growth anymore Client has been all over the map since COVID Direct CPU sales to consumers have been good but Intel has walked all over AMD in actual sales to OEMs even when their chips were inferior In fact its the only thing bankrolling Intels turnaround attempt now The jury is out here AMD is expanding product offerings later this year time will tell if their sales team has figured out their own deficiencies AI PCs simply dont matter now and when they finally matter someday Intel will be the one to bring it to customers in volume in the most premium laptops Thats just how it has always worked So the only bright spot is AI AMD is competitive enough to sell but capacity is holding up the show If AMD took a big gamble on supply maybe this is a major growth driver in 2025 but big gambles are the opposite of their investment strategy for the last 10 years NVDA bet big on supply and got ahead of customer demand last year Im in all shares at 70 average cost basis having added some at the last dip down to 60 and back up to 100 Im looking at the big pile of meh and wondering how long its going to be until the market declares AMD dead money and smacks it back below 100 Money is tight all around its every man for himself Youre not a man May we have a lil look at your bags

well ITM I am looking at rolling it over but struggling to see an expiry and price that will leave me with a credit Obviously it will need to be more than 240 33090 for me to be in net credit if i roll Look forward to your thoughts and really appreciate the advise Thanks You still have 24 days left on your put If your thesis says it a good stock to run the wheel I would just let it ride or wait for a potential bounce and close them for a net profit Thank you makes sense I just sold a couple 28 30 dte intc puts today so ill probably end up bagholding with u Why would you need 240 in credit Look at July or August and even if you keep same strikes you will get some positive credit and then it will get your a lot of extrinsic value even if it goes deep ITM say 27 It may bounce in this time span All what would matter in this case if at the end of expiration it gets above your strike or not Yes you will be looking at higher closing amount should you roll and decide to close it earlier if it keeps going down further I have similar situation and I am neutral to bit bullish for it to bounce back in 35 range at least Can say the time span for it though I sold 3050 puts Bollocks Roll it out for debit intel is not going anywhere soon Wait until you get assigned and then sell calls You could also keep rolling a deep ITM put but its much easier and more profitable to get assigned and sell OTM calls The actual position is the same but the OTM calls have better liquidity and require fewer trades Im selling puts at 28 and 29 This seems like an incredible bargain for shares of this company Im in a similar position Ill just keep rolling out when I get to 1421 DTE Ill roll it out to 50 DTE plus or minus It might take a year Ugh Give it some time and roll out Down too if you can do

1979 at 700W httpscdnwccftechcomwpcontentuploads202210NVIDIAHopperH100GPUSpecificationspng And this was before Blackwell so it did already seem to me that apart from CUDAs stickiness Nvidia was also ahead in the important flops per watt compared to D1 as power becomes a pretty dominant factor in supercomputer costs So naturally they needed a D2 D3 D4 etc to stay in the game and try to keep up let alone leapfrogging Nvidia if thats possible Though of course its their silicon and probably punches above its weight in specific areas like autolabeller Perfwatt at the chip level is not the whole story Dojo D1 should reduce a lot of the power required for chiptochip and boardtoboard communication which is a significant part of the power budget for AI training systems Isnt one of the benefits of Dojo the throughputbandwidth As its built for video The other factor is paying nVidias massive margins on their chips Blackwell isnt really a better chip on a cost or efficiency basis it just allows lower precision math which improves speed for certain kinds of models idk if FSD uses that Would have been nice to know that at the quarterly call It very much was talked about in the call

people mention online a few times particularly in reference to the remaster vs the original but have not once seen any interview or statement by Mikael referenced in which this is confirmed I have a 2003 vinyl of the album and the performances of the remaster sound the same to me so I initially wrote this off as an online rumor that originated from nowhere However lately Ive been relearning Benighted for a planned cover and have been using a version of the 51 mix as a reference as the parts are a little easier to discern and have been noticing nuances in the actual performance that Im certain arent the same as the original For example comparing the opening riff of the 51 mix here to the remaster here theres a noticeable slide when the melody goes up to the E on the remaster that doesnt happen in the 51 mix Theres a similar nuance missing in the second riff and others throughout the song Ive noticed I also found someone mention on here fairly recently that the acoustics were rerecorded only for the 51 mix not the remaster Can anyone confirm this Is there any statementinterviewold forum post by Mikael in which he talks about this I can confirm this based on an interview Mikael did where he talked about this and he mentioned it was sort of hard for him simply because he had to relearn how to play every acoustic section since he had forgotten the parts It was a video interview I pretty sure and the main reason for the was that the old masters for the acoustic guitars were gone or unusable for whatever reason Ie been trying to find the interview but I haven been successful Interesting Was he talking about the remaster or just the 51 mix I only notice performance differences between the originalremaster and the 51 The remaster performances sound identical to the original to me Please do post that interview if you find it Im in the middle of learning Benighted over the last two months so this is super interesting  I too notice the tiny differences Yes It is obvious in that they are clearly different performances The remaster is a remaster so cannot possibly feature the rerecorded acoustics Yeah that makes sense Ive seen more people claiming the remaster had a different performance than the 51 but that never made sense to me so I initially disbelieved Mikael ever rerecorded the parts entirely The more I listen to the 51 mix the more I believe it has different performances Still its hard for me to believe that he would go to that length just for the 51 on top of the fact that Ive never seen him talk about it Listening now it seems clear that the Benighted solo was retracked as well not just the acoustics so I wonder how much else was redone I would have thought that Mikael would be one to prioritize the sanctity of the original recording enough to say no to the idea I recently bought the remaster vinyl The version I was used to was apparently the original mix of the album It felt like listening to a different album to be honest It took me a while to adjust Still prefer the original mix despite being technically worse im just so used to it The vinyl remaster is the original mix Why Lattice Semiconductor LSCC Shares Are

2024-05-01,"1 month post negative txn rcdiff positive again First treatment vancomycin seemed like it did nothing stool looked unhealthy Second treatment Dificid stool looked healthy and i seemed to back back to normal Now 1 month later there was a day where i had some diahrea and produced some blood So i did a stool test It came back positive for B toxin Doctor wants to put me back on Vancomycin but pulse Hes telling me to wait until symptoms get very bad He said he not going to give Dificid Should i be waiting until my symptoms get very bad Is it possible to return to normal with a positive toxin test Wouldnt it make sense to begin treatment before it recolonizes so bad that its causing bleeding aka while the issue is small Absolutely NOT you should not wait until symptoms get bad Wtf Currently im only going once a day and its formed just pale and soft But hes telling me to wait until i get watery diahrea 3x per day This doesnt make sense to me Has anyone here heard this from a doctor And im really worried about doing Vancomycin again i felt it wasnt nearly as effective as dificid You need a new doctor Try raw crushed garlic 3 times a day for 4 days first Its anti bacterial and a prebiotic I went from diarrhea 3 times a day to once  better results than vanco long term Then added probiotics and fermented foods and got better You are saying that you had a positive toxin test and recovered without antibiotics AMD confirms Radeon GPU sales have nosedived 100 cheaper at similar raster performance honestly isnt competitive pricing for Radeon cards They should just slash prices more This is like if a Lexus was only 10 more expensive than its Toyota counterpart Exactly right At lower priceperf tiers youre running at 1080p1440p where superior DLSS image quality really matters At higher tiers youre spending 800 on a GPU you want to play pathtraced games right So at the highend Nvidias RT performance gap matters Either way Nvidia wins AMD needs to be cheaper Nothing to worry about nvidia will just increase its prices AMD needs to be more competitive price wise They kinda just need to be more competitive featurewise then the current prices are great I think they just need to lower prices even further Even the 7600 and 7600 XT would be much more palatable if they were priced lower than they are At least we can buy GPUs again though As much as I really didnt want to buy Nvidia when the Supers released thats what I ended up doing Got a 4080S instead of a 7900XTX after a LOT of deliberation the prices are still comparable and Nvidia wins on the features side of things Competition in the GPU space is getting better but still has a ways to go Competition in the GPU space is getting better but still has a ways to go I think amd has pulled out of the high end market so theres no gonna be any competition for the 5080 and 5090 AMDs video cards are falling short on modern features compared to Nvidias offerings Despite promises the 7000 series cards are still waiting on Antilag  with no ETA in sight Meanwhile FSR remains stagnant at version 22 lacking the performance and quality seen in Nvidias DLSS 35 and Xess 13 upscaling technologies Nvidia sets itself apart with more stable drivers superior ray tracing capabilities and a suite of RTX Broadcast software that includes remarkable noise and echo removal for microphones video enhancements and webcam improvements Their RTXHDR brings HDR to nonHDR content RTX remix remasters games at the driver level Reflex outperforms standard Antilag and Chat RTX offers a local AI Chatbot Nvidias frequent driver updates and regular enhancements to DLSS DLL Meanwhile AMD has only introduced AFMF in the driver and limited FSR 3 integration in a handful of games over the past year and a half with no significant upscaling improvements or new features Its clear that AMD is struggling to keep up and their recent announcement of no plans for a topend GPU in the next generation signals trouble Perhaps focusing on APUs for consoles and laptops is their best bet moving forward It seems like AMD is dropping the ball hard in the discrete GPU market and this might just be the beginning of the end for them in that arena AMDs explanation in the earnings presentation says Due to lower semicustom and Radeon GPU sales so weak sales number of consoles probably also contributed Who wants to spend 500 on a console that hasnt already done so when mid cycle refresh is rumored soon Maybe try something other than Nvidia minus 50 as a strategy And the 150250 range is a joke Nvidia 50 and any interesting techfeatures Pretty much  Iin the market for a card and AMD donrealise they have to massively undercut Nvidia on price per performance to even consider giving up DLSS and other industry defining features lower dem prices then They released 8001K GPUs literally no one wanted Then they released cheaper GPUs that were barely upgrades from the previous generation but at higher prices than the 6xxx series The low to midrange was atrocious with the 7600 and 7800XT offering no generational increase in performance or cheaper FPS per dollar The 7700XT was the only improved card but was so overpriced it was a slap in the face I think RTX 40 Super cards pushed many people in that direction that might have considered AMD otherwise I was debating between a 4070Ti or 7900XT for awhile last year but 4070Ti was a hard sell at its price with 12GB VRAM Once 4070Ti Super released it was a no brainer even if 7900XT was 50 cheaper RDNA3 really was a failure for AMD Reported hardware bugs around launch costing performance on the high end chips poor efficiency RT and upscaling when compared to RTX 40 All of that and AMD still refuses to sell them at a significant discount to even appear competitive Once Nvidia sweetened the deal a bit with the Super cards it should be an easy decision for most people to pay a bit of a premium and get a much better GPU Itgoing to suck when NVIDIA is the only company selling highend GPUs though AMDs gaming revenue nosedives 48 not expected to recover until 2025 AMDs gaming business earned 922 million in Q1 2024 down 48 yearoveryear from 1757 billion and down 33 quarteroverquarter from 1368 billion AMDs gaming segment still posted an operating income of 151 million but thats a significant decline from 314 million a year ago As a percentage of revenue the gaming units operating income totaled 16 in Q1 2024 and 18 in Q1 2023 Its believed that systemonchips SoCs for Microsofts Xbox Series XS and Sonys PlayStation 5 account for the lions share of AMDs gaming business These consoles are now in their fifth year on the market so demand for these products is understandably waning Thats why the platform holders have reduced their purchases of AMD processors When it comes to sales of discrete GPUs the situation is a bit more complex Sales of addinboards for desktops decline seasonally in the first quarter every year While AMD gained market share in Q4 2023 controlling 19 of the market according to Jon Peddie Research the company obviously sold fewer Radeon GPUs for desktops in Q1 2024 Moreover the company did not have big design wins with its Radeon RX 7000M GPUs for laptops which dramatically impacted its gaming revenues as volumewise such GPUs typically sell in similar quantities as those for desktops httpswwwtomshardwarecompccomponentsgpusamdsgamingrevenuenosedives48notexpectedtorecoveruntil2025 The RX 6000 series seemed to be booming especially with price cuts I know way more people using AMD now than ever before for their GPU But tbh the RX 7000 series feels sorta like the RTX 4000 series where you see similar tiered cards performing too similar to their last gen tiers ie 3060 Ti vs 4060 Ti RX 6800XT vs RX 7800XT The Rx580 is still their best selling GPU of all time but they had really solid sales during the 5000 series and the 5700xt was a huge seller Then it dropped a fair amount with the 6000 series and even more with the 7000 series httpswww3dcenterorgdateienabbildungenGPUAddinBoardMarketShare2002toQ42023png GPU sales are on the up but AMDs RX 7000series graphics cards are its least competitive in 20 years httpswwwpcgamercomhardwaregraphicscardsgpusalesareontheupbutamdsrx7000seriesgraphicscardsareitsworstsellinginover20years They probably need to be more aggressive with lowering pricing and to also work on developing their own unique features That would alleviate a lot of their issues Price to performance on gpus even from amd just isnthat exciting right now and pretty much everyone that wanted a ps5xsxxss already have one It doesnhelp that everyone is focused on ai rather than gaming right now Im a 7900 xt user but priceperformance ie value is the only good thing about AMD GPUs tbh All their Nvidia counterparts such as FSR ray tracing are okay but still inferior to Nvidias offerings Even features like GSync vs freesync and low latency mode is more polished with Nvidia If someone has a bit more disposable income buying an Nvidia card is a non nonsense decision I can understand why Nvidia has 80 discreet GPU market share And then theres rumors the RX 8000 series is going to be mid range only no high end Ouch Donmidrange usually sell a lot more than highend The consoles being in their 5th year is crazy Feels like only a couple years ago people were struggling to get their hands on them Yeah feels like it wasnt that long ago that they released Time flies I suppose Maybe release some AMD Laptops and fix issues plaguing AMD Advantage

then AMD and then founded Nvidia Teslas next generation Dojo chipD2 is already in production according to TSMC Dojo D1 should be worth 362Tflops in Bfloat16 at 400W httpsireddit05cua2qkhgi71jpg One H100 should be worth 1979 at 700W httpscdnwccftechcomwpcontentuploads202210NVIDIAHopperH100GPUSpecificationspng And this was before Blackwell so it did already seem to me that apart from CUDAs stickiness Nvidia was also ahead in the important flops per watt compared to D1 as power becomes a pretty dominant factor in supercomputer costs So naturally they needed a D2 D3 D4 etc to stay in the game and try to keep up let alone leapfrogging Nvidia if thats possible Though of course its their silicon and probably punches above its weight in specific areas like autolabeller Youe forgetting that Nvidia isn a charity They don sell chips at cost Heck theye practically getting software margins on their training chipsat least for now Last time i punched in number for it D1 lost on all metrics flip and flopwatt against the H100 as well as amds and Intels offerings And against Google TPU as well Its a 20202021 era chip D1 is just out of date NVIDIA is so far ahead of everyone A former engineer who left recently said he thinks it a decade before anyone catches up Is the higher energy req because of the increased bandwidth between the 25 d1 chips that are in 1 dojo tile What is Dojo exactly Basically an ASIC for neural networks Feel like that is easier said than done or others would be doing it Not an ASIC actually a many core general purpose CPU Other companies do have deep learning ASICs Best known is Google TPU AWS also has their own deep learning training and inference ASICs Microsoft and Meta have both said theye developing their own But it not just the chip The really hard part of these systems is getting the interconnect and compilers to work efficiently Without that the TFLOPs per chip are completely meaningless since they will only be utilizing a tiny fraction They also require a very different style of actually designing the neural network models which generally doesn play nice with Nvidia chips All of that is why I remain extremely skeptical of Dojo It just doesn make sense for Tesla to build their own chip given their scale is so much smaller than the big tech companies In addition we keep getting these vague n productionstatements that very few months but the actual benchmarks never materialize It looks like OP posted an AMP link These should load faster but AMP is controversial because of concerns over privacy and the Open Web Maybe check out the canonical page instead httpsspectrumieeeorgtsmcadvancedpackaging Im a bot  Why  About  Summon uAmputatorBot I guess my question is why bother Is it because of cost and availability of nVIDIA products The time and cost of designing your own chip taping it out and testing it designing the hardware interconnect and data center infrastructure around it and then writing the drivers and kernels to support your chip around it is very high and for Tesla its for internal use only and notforsale to customers Is all of that worth it to squeeze more flops here and there Even AMD is having a hard time getting their foot in the door of this business when some of their MI300X specs look better than H100 Meanwhile all of that is nVIDIAs core business and theyve jumpstarted their data center business since Jensen delivered their first DGX1 to Elon in 2016 for OpenAI So why  Seems pointless given the rate of improvement in AI chips and the availability Also I kinda doubt that this chip is easier for them to get their hands on than other GPUs At the end of the day its silicon and it has to come from places like TSMC etc So youre either paying to use TSMCs capacity or NVDA

Sounded great Congrats on the deal! Good to see the update that you bought it. But again... gotta do it... Girl Bike!! Hope you do well on the sale. :) That's a baaad ride AMD to Redesign Ray Tracing Hardware on RDNA 4 A good article from last year about RDNA raytracing: https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/03/22/raytracing-on-amds-rdna-2-3-and-nvidias-turing-and-pascal/ I certainly hope this proves true. RT has reached the point where it's important enough that AMD needs to dedicate a larger portion of die space to it. AMD's current solution is a level 2 solution, the bare minimum for on-GPU hardware RT. They need to move to at least a level 3 solution (hardware BVH processing) in the next generation just to improve performance, and level 4(ish) if they want to reach parity with NVIDIA. The article didn't mention anything about level 2-4. Where are the definitions of these? Notes: RayTracing Hardware-Level classification according to ImgTec (Level 3.5 is an inofficial extension by 3DCenter forums), Source: 3DCenter.org  From now it all depends on PC ports willingness to crank the RT presets up, games like RE4 or R&C rift apart are light ports that even RDNA3 can run them with ease . Consoles are designed with RDNA2 mind so in 5 year interval don't expect RT becoming norm . Next gen Consoles of course will have better ray tracing support. And will most likely still be AMD. PS5 Pro is rumoured to be coming at the end of the year with greatly improved ray tracing hardware Dragon's Dogma 2 has RTGI enabled on consoles by default (except Series S?). Turning them off makes the game look really bad. ""to redesign"" Should be ""redesigned"". The way that hardware works, RDNA4 should have been designed and taped out for months already. I've been a PC enthusiast since before the 3dfx era and I can't remember when was the last time AMD/ATI had a feature that Nvidia didn't and/or performed with that feature. The closest I can think of was when HL2 launched and the Radeon 9700 pro embarrassed the GeForce FX generation before it even launched. I remember Nvidia using physx to differentiate even though their hardware wasn't necessarily better, tesselation performance especially in titles that abused it to slow down Radeon as much as possible, their better video encoders especially in the pascal era, and now with both tensor cores and RT cores for the past few years  Turing launched way back in 2018 almost 6 years ago showing where Nvidia wanted to go next with both AI and RT, hasn't AMD learned anything from the past? Nvidia was clearly going to use their edge even if in only a few titles to persuade customers on the fence towards their extra features . Clearly people don't really care that Nvidia isn't faster in raster (except with the 4090, but that's in a league of its own) for the most part even if most games are raster only.  I mean, sure, it's hard... But it's been years now. We're going into the fourth generation of AMD GPUs since Turing launched with AMD being consistently a gen behind with these features... I like AMD hardware, especially in Linux. But right now I'm kinda rooting for Intel to disrupt the GPU market. AMD has dropped the ball too much for me to have any faith. Just when RDNA2 had me thinking they had it, they dropped the ball again with RDNA3 being barely an improvement over 2.

ASML is claiming that the EXE already solves the throughput issue via the stage; the EXE stage accelerates so much faster than the NXE stage that they are claiming equal or better throughput for the high-NA tool. Whether this can be retrofitted back onto the NXEs is not yet clear. The faster slide is only made possible by the EXE's change in the projection optics. The bottleneck was never the slide mechanism, it's the power of the light being used for the lithography that dictates the limits for how fast they can move the slide around.

They are making a big mistake Globalisation and Its Impact Globalisation took off in the 1990s, driven by a belief in the power of markets. Governments loosened controls on travel, investment, and trade. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organisation, boosting trade between Asia and the West. Globalisation reduced poverty and inequality and increased political freedom worldwide. Challenges of Globalisation The financial crisis of 2007-09 highlighted the dangers of free-flowing capital markets. Globalisation slowed; Britain voted for Brexit; America and China started a trade war. Rise of Homeland Economics Homeland economics aims to reduce risks to a country?셲 economy from market fluctuations, unpredictable shocks like pandemics, or actions of geopolitical opponents. It is a response to four major shocks: economic, geopolitical, energy, and the threat posed by generative AI to workers. Homeland economics aims to mesh national security and economic policy. Implementation of Homeland Economics Governments are raising tariffs and investing in R&D. They are building up national champions in strategic industries like computer chips, electric vehicles, and AI. They are implementing subsidies and domestic-content requirements to encourage local production. Western governments are using economic tools to weaken geopolitical adversaries. Legislation and Investments Under President Joe Biden, America implemented the Chips Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The EU launched its Green Deal Industrial Plan and its own version of the Chips Act. India set up a large ?쐏roduction-linked incentives??scheme for many sectors. South Korea offers tax breaks to semiconductor firms under the K-Chips Act. Corporate Response and Investor Sentiment Corporations are reshoring production to their home countries. Investors are backing companies that support the national interest. Critique of Homeland Economics Homeland economics is based on an overly pessimistic reading of neoliberal globalisation. The benefits of the new approach are uncertain. Attempts to break free economically from China are likely to be partial at best. The benefits of green subsidies for the fight against climate change are less clear than proponents admit. The costs are clear: research by the IMF considers a hypothetical world split into America- and China-led blocs, resulting in lower global output. Governments are likely to waste a lot of money, which is not a good plan given the demands from healthcare and pensions, and already-large deficits. Future of Homeland Economics In ten years, the West will probably be roughly as reliant on China as it is today, and as unequal and as slow-growing. Politicians may double down on industrial policy, believing its only weakness was that it was applied with insufficient enthusiasm. Napoleon Bonaparte and Supply Chains Napoleon Bonaparte?셲 comment about the torment of precautions often exceeding the dangers to be avoided is still relevant in the context of supply chains. Governments and companies are seeking to protect themselves from disruptions, fearing actions from leaders like Vladimir Putin or China. Buzzwords and Plans Politicians want to ?쐂ecouple??from China, others speak of ?쐂erisking?? focusing on the one-third of total trade deemed to be ?쐓trategic?? ?쏞hina-plus-one??is a new boardroom mantra, suggesting a business should supplement a Chinese supplier with a non-Chinese backup. ?쏤riendshoring?? sometimes via ?쐍earshoring?? can help achieve these goals. Global Trading System Before the pandemic, the global trading system focused on efficiency. In Britain, the average cash price of durable goods fell by 15% from 2001 to 2016. Trade expanded the variety of goods on offer. Efficiency vs Resilience Efficiency is believed to have come at the expense of resilience. The Economist found that price volatility for about 300 American imports was falling from 2005 to 2019. Pandemic Impact In 2020 and 2021, many goods were in short supply, causing prices to soar. Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, last year, said global supply chains have become vulnerable to disruptions. Supply Chain Failure vs Demand Surge It?셲 important to distinguish true supply-chain failure from delays caused by an unprecedented surge in demand. For example, Britain imported 16,000 tonnes of hand sanitiser in 2019 at $2.90 a kilo. In 2020, Britain imported 86,000 tonnes, with the average price rising only to $3.50. Semiconductor Supply In 2021, global semiconductor companies shipped 1.2 trillion units, 15% up on the year before. America?셲 physical imports of semiconductors were up by 30% over 2020. China?셲 Dominance Many fear that the Chinese Communist Party is willing to weaponise its dominance of supply chains. China accounts for about 80% of the production of the raw materials used to manufacture solar cells, but also the cells themselves, and the modules into which they are assembled. Reducing China Exposure Western firms are trying to reduce their China exposure. One option is to reshore production. In America, construction spending in the manufacturing sector, relative to GDP, is up. Another option is to move from a ?쐉ust in time??to a ?쐉ust in case??mode of production. International Stage Firms are finding new, non-Chinese trading partners. From 2018 to 2021, ?쐓trategic??imports from China to the West fell from 33.5% of the total to 31.9%. Problems with Decoupling The task is enormous. For example, it will take Germany 35 years to pull out just half of the total FDI that it has in China. Many alternatives to China are also unpalatable. In 2022, for the first time, Thailand and Vietnam combined received more greenfield FDI than China. Direct imports have fallen, but the West is importing a lot more from countries which rely ever more heavily on Chinese exports. Conclusion The recent history of supply chains reveals that when bad things happen, markets can adjust fairly well. Despite talk of a supply-chain revolution, the world will remain largely interdependent. The more noticeable change will be the rising cost of doing business. Homeland Economics and Inequality Politicians argue that homeland economics will reduce inequality. They attribute the widening income and wealth disparities to the globalization of the 1990s and 2000s, which led to the decline of manufacturing jobs due to the ?쏞hina shock?? Both sides aim to restore these jobs and the industrial working class. Disappearance of Old-Style Jobs In recent decades, old-style jobs have significantly decreased. In 1990, about 30% of workers in the rich world were in industrial jobs, which has now reduced to about 20%. This period also saw a sharp rise in pre-tax income inequality and an increase in ?쐂eaths of despair?? involving overdoses from opioids. Impact of Trade Surge Many economists partially attribute these changes to a surge in trade, especially with China. Exports from China to the rich world rose at an average annual rate of 17% in the decade leading up to 2008. This led to a ?쏞hina shock??in some countries, where cheap imports destroyed the local manufacturing base. Research on Globalization Research by David Autor of MIT and colleagues found that rising imports from China led to higher unemployment, lower labor-force participation, and reduced wages in local labor markets. However, economists tend to exaggerate the China shock. Despite some localized hardships, the China shock is a rounding error for the US workforce overall. Technological Improvements vs Trade A new paper by Lorenzo Caliendo of Yale University and Fernando Parro of Penn State concludes that the long-term decline in manufacturing employment is largely due to technological improvements, not trade. Despite the surge in factory construction, manufacturing jobs are not coming back. Impact on the Poor While there are uncertain gains for rich-world workers, those in the poor world are likely to lose out. During the golden age of globalization, global poverty and inequality fell sharply. However, the costs of a more closed trading system will outweigh these bonuses. The poor in China could suffer, and the poor elsewhere are likely to suffer too. Potential Benefits of Homeland Economics Homeland economics could have benefits for all through new investments in clean technologies, which politicians say will push the world closer to a net-zero future. Industrial Policy and Its Impact  In 1987, the U.S. government and industry formed an R&D consortium called Sematech with an annual subsidy of $100m ($250m in today?셲 money) to boost semiconductor production . Research by Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College and Peter Klenow of Stanford University in 1994 found no evidence that Sematech changed Current Industrial Policy Trends: Governments are offering subsidies worth $400bn in the coming years to boost capacity. The EU aims to have 20% of global chip manufacturing by 2030. Governments also want to incentivize production of rare earths, batteries, and solar panels. Successes of Industrial Policy: DARPA, a government organization, was successful in conducting groundbreaking research after World War II. Kia, a South Korean car firm, opened a car plant near Atlanta in 2009 with significant government help. Failures of Industrial Policy: A review by Gary Hufbauer and Euijin Jung of the Peterson Institute of American industrial policy between 1970 and 2020 found few successes. Geoffrey Owen of the London School of Economics argues that attempts to create competitive advantage through government direction and support were generally unsuccessful.  Nathan Lane of Oxford University studied the impact of South Korea's industrial push? He found intentional industrial policies likely played a critical role in creating the modern South Korean economy . In the 20 years after 1973, South Korean real GDP per head rose by 349%.  Government subsidies as a share of the profits of Chinese-listed companies rose from 3% in 2012 to 5% in 2020 . However, it is unclear whether China as a whole has benefited from industrial policy . India?셲 PLI Scheme: India?셲 ?쐏roduction-linked incentives??(PLI) scheme pays manufacturers a sum for every unit produced. However, a recent paper by Rahul Chauhan, Rohit Lamba, and Raghuram Rajan points out that mobile-phone imports also jumped, suggesting that producers were simply re-exporting phones via India to get the subsidy. Challenges in Implementing Industrial Policies: Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, a big Taiwanese producer, told Nancy Pelosi, a senior Democrat, that American efforts to rebuild chip manufacturing at home were doomed. The firm says that production at its first plant in Arizona will be delayed until 2025 due to a shortage of specialist workers.  There are already questions about value for money . A report by Britain's National Audit Office noted that the PLI scheme needs to be improved . Focus on Growth Distribution: Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden?셲 national-security adviser, argued in April that growth is less important, focusing on its distribution. If governments can reduce inequality and boost the fortunes of blue-collar workers, then perhaps it does not matter if real GDP increases less quickly. Climate Change and the Role of Subsidies Inadequacy of Old Proposals: Traditional methods to combat climate change, such as carbon taxation, have proven insufficient. Global temperatures are projected to rise over 2째C above pre-industrial levels. Subsidies as a Solution: Subsidies have been implemented at a large scale with some success. For instance, Germany?셲 generous subsidies for solar power in the early 2000s led to a significant decrease in the price of solar generation. Current Subsidies and Future Plans: The subsidies today are larger, and more are planned. America?셲 Inflation Reduction Act will provide $400bn-$1trn over the next decade to support renewable energy. Japan plans to allocate $150bn towards its Green Transformation policy. Since 2020, governments have announced over $1.3trn worth of clean-energy subsidies. New Subsidies vs Old Subsidies: The new subsidies differ from those that sparked the solar revolution. They are aimed at both installation and manufacture, unlike most previous subsidies which focused on installation. Domestic Content Requirements: The subsidies include numerous ?쐂omestic content requirements?? For example, for an American buyer to receive the full $7,500 credit for an electric vehicle under the IRA, a significant portion of the car must have been made in North America. Climate Case for Capacity-plus-jobs Subsidies: The argument for capacity-plus-jobs subsidies is compelling. Any plan to free an economy from fossil-fuel dependence will create losers. To succeed politically, it must therefore mobilise groups of winners more powerful and passionate than those losers. Risks of Green Subsidies: Green subsidies come with significant risks. New research on the IRA by economists at the European Central Bank (ECB) highlights some concerns. Foreign companies may lose economies of scale and imports if they are blocked from supplying a domestic market. Time Constraint and Innovation: The world needs to decarbonise quickly, but it will take years for countries to build up domestic capacity in green energy and transport. There is also the issue of innovation. If domestic firms are insulated from competition, they may be less motivated to discover the latest, cleanest ways of making solar panels. Pros and Cons of New Green Subsidies: It is unclear whether the benefits of the new green subsidies outweigh the drawbacks. They may create powerful green interest groups, but subsidies can be inefficient, and there are many of them on offer. Thus, these plans are considered a second-best policy. The shift from globalization to homeland economics is a complex issue with many facets. Here are some additional details to consider:  The impact of increased trade with China is often cited as a major factor in the loss of manufacturing jobs . Technological advancements and automation have also played a significant role in the decline of manufacturing employment . Boston, Dallas, and Los Angeles, which experienced significant increases in import exposure, continued to thrive .  New manufacturing jobs often require higher levels of education and skills . In the U.S., the manufacturing workforce is more likely to have a degree than the overall average . Two-thirds of Dutch workers aged 25 to 34 have tertiary education .  Attempts by rich countries to produce more at home could deprive developing economies of lucrative employers . This could potentially drive millions of people into extreme poverty . Future Implications: The shift towards homeland economics represents a major policy change that could have long-term consequences. If these policies fail to achieve their objectives, it could lead to even more protectionism and industrial policy. The year 2024, packed with elections, could mark a turning point in Western economic history. In conclusion, while the shift towards homeland economics is driven by legitimate concerns about economic inequality and national security, it?셲 important to consider the potential unintended consequences of this policy shift. The challenge for policymakers is to find a balance between addressing these concerns and avoiding the pitfalls of protectionism and industrial policy. source India?셲 PLI Scheme: India?셲 ?쐏roduction-linked incentives??(PLI) scheme pays manufacturers a sum for every unit produced. However, a recent paper by Rahul Chauhan, Rohit Lamba, and Raghuram Rajan points out that mobile-phone imports also jumped, suggesting that producers were simply re-exporting phones via India to get the subsidy. Disagree with this. Imported phones are for the domestic market which aren't manufactured here. India does indeed do a lot of assembling and it's value added % will grow with time. Ex: Apple looking to build it's camera modules here, micron factory could assemble chips for apple That paper is also 6-7 months old. A lot has changed since then. I think the article itself is pretty old Is this a copy paste from the source you linked just without the paywall and images? This is less a post and more a series of bullet pointed lists tangentially tied together; the formatting is off. Countries are creating industrial policy in large part because China just keeps spamming out subsidies like its doing Kirby down Bs. It's the prisoners dilemma, if a major country keeps doing massive subsidies to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars annually, restricts foreign imports, encourages export dumping, and doesn't respect IP. Then you're going to have to respond in kind just out of protecting your markets from being abused.  In a fair world China would have already long since started deindustrialization and would be looking towards its first couple years of having imports be larger than exports . But Xi refuses to allow China to be dependent on anyone, so he orders the government to subsidize the hell out of heavy industry and green energy .  The ultimate loser in all this is the average Chinese citizen, their wages are devalued, their worker rights are restricted, their investments are high risk at best, their work opportunities are shrinking, and they're subsidizing wealthy factory owners with their taxes . The root cause is that the CCP is more interested in invading Vietnam and Taiwan than creating the best At this point we're just waiting for the facade to collapse in on itself like Japan in the 90s and the world dealing with a Chinese lost decade. I largely agree. In anther world China?셲 investment as % of GDP should already be dropping and consumption as % of GDP should be going up. Instead, we see a country with the world?셲 highest level of investment GDP, and this is not some random, tiny country that has just started industrialization. It's annoying, and almost funny, to think about it. A hard-working Chinese citizen?셲 tax money is subsidizing a random American?셲 purchase of a bullshit gadget on Amazon or Temu. This is most of the answer. But I think you have to stress a bit more the national security dimensions. One could ask how China today is different from Japan in the past. Why are we seeing an expansion of industrial policy? Why not just let markets resolve these distortions? Like relatively few people care if Japanese cars dominate the market, helped along thru industrial policy. W/China the fear is that state-sponsored overcapacity will be used as leverage against other countries. ""No one else can produce X, so agree to our terms or else"" Or ""look we can quickly repurpose factories to make UAVs, shells etc. Don't mess with us"" But why? Just consume from China if they want to keep making. What's the point of putting tariffs and making yourself work hard to again make the same goods again with far more expense? We should be sending China a thank-you card. They're taking taxpayer money that they could be spending on their military, research or infrastructure and are instead spending it on subsidizing Americans' and Europeans' purchases of quality goods. It's also opening up new jobs because input costs are down. Americans and Europeans could have cheap electric vehicles but don't and we're spending outrageous amounts of money on clean energy investments that are insulated from competitive pressure and so of dubious quality. We should be taking advantage of Xi's foolishness instead of duplicating it. tldr- honestly just read it,  The shift from globalization to homeland economics is driven by concerns about economic inequality and national security . The shift represents a major policy change that could have long-term consequences . Policymakers face the challenge of finding a balance between addressing these concerns and avoiding the pitfalls of protectionism .  I disagree with the premise of this article/report/whatever it is . Is it a copy of the article you cite as a source verbatim, but with no images? Say that. Is it an article with no image? Is it just a summary or a copy? I cannot read the actual article at hand .  At a fundamental level the main criticism of industrial policy seems to be that its hard to do right as a government . Noone can deny the extremely transformative influence that government leadership has when setting industrial targets due to the historical results . Contemporary examples - such as Taiwan, Japan, China and India make it very clear that even done messily it can be  What happens if we don't try to encourage the restructuring of Western economies in a directed way? I'd argue, bad things, in particular to democratic legitimacy and security . Letting China et al make everything abroad is a bad strategic idea because then you put yourself at the mercy of foreign powers .  As a whole my opinion on industrial policy is - lets stop talking about whether or not to do industrial policy and how to do it well . We should be looking for the best practices/implementation and less like a policy lever that is verboten for ideological reasons . Its just a tool amongst all the other policy tools we have to affect society last point - is it just me or does the title of this post and its conclusion say two different things? Governments across the world are rediscovering industrial policy. They are making a big mistake vs In conclusion, while the shift towards homeland economics is driven by legitimate concerns about economic inequality and national security, it?셲 important to consider the potential unintended consequences of this policy shift. The challenge for policymakers is to find a balance between addressing these concerns and avoiding the pitfalls of protectionism and industrial policy. The headline is sensational and bombastic. Its pretty clickbaity. The conclusion is much more measured and closer to a rational take on the subject.

AMD's CEO wanted to be the CEO of the joint company. The NVIDIA CEO said he wanted to be the CEO. No compromise was found so the deal died right there. That's how I remember it... If amd were to buy nvidia why would nvidia's ceo be the ceo of the joint company? This is back in the days of nForce motherboards from Nvidia. If ATI bought Nvidia it would have led to the biggest hardware monopoly you???ever seen I remember nforce chipsets being a requirement for using multiple 8800s in SLI. Wow that was such a long time ago. Probably a good thing for consumers they didn???buy Nvidia because I could only imagine how much of a monopoly AMD would have with Nvidia???resources. Quite the blunder for AMD retrospectively. Edit: you guys have alot of great input and the market would look IMMENSELY Different if AMD acquired Nvidia, it may be that Intel buys ATI for less than AMD would have and dominates in Console APUs. However my perspective is Jensen Huang would have eventually overtaken AMD as the official CEO particularly when reading, *""AMD???first target: Nvidia. But Nvidia Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang (see our January 7, 2008 cover story on Nvidia ""Shoot to Kill"") insisted on being chief executive of the combined company, according to a former AMD employee (Nvidia declined to comment for this story).""* this is probably the reason Hector Ruiz declined Huang's terms as he would have been a threat to his authority in AMD, and why they went with ATI instead. Also looking at Dirk Meyers performance of AMD it seems like having a Taiwanese Electrical Engineer is themeta as both Lisa Sue and Jensen Haung are both those. Thanks We don???know that Nvidia would have done as well under AMD. It could be that where they are now is where they would have been. Im sure I could figure this out with a quick Google search, but how long did AMD continue to use the ATI brand? My laptop from ~2009-2010 had ATI graphics. IIRC it was the HD6000 series when they switched over to AMD branding as I remember having an HD5750 that was still ATI branding.

Their vertical integration makes both the consumer and server segments highly dependent on foundry. Although the upcoming Arrow Lake processors will be partially based on TSMC nodes, freeing those segments from their dependence, while still keeping all the benefits if foundry becomes competitve again. So long term consumer and server can only benefit from foundry and worst case survive on their own.  Intel is still on track with foundry for 2024 with 20A and 2025 with 18A and 14A nodes . Foundry is a very hard to ramp up business, that only generates profits in the long term . Investors had too much short term confidence in Intel's foundry business . I am certain Intel CPU's on TSMC nodes will be competitive, especially since intel ordered 3nm, giving it an edge over Amd (1) So that leaves two options: Foundry is sucessfull in the next 3-5 years: 2. Foundry is not sucessfull: Intel's Marketcap right now at 30$ per stock is around 130B, while it's net assets are valued at 192.7B. (2) I only see Intel making progress from here on. As an investor I feel even safer knowing they are severly undervalued right now, even ignoring future foundry growth potential. I for my part bought the dip, but remember I am highly regarded.

The bulls might win tomorrow or in eight month or even in a year or two. I just want to take the entire run, that's why I put in my money now. It's not going bankrupt and it's going to make money, but it's just become your boring partner that freely gives you missionary sex. Now that?셲 the analogy I can get behind  This price is ignorrying basicly any grown intel book value , invest in intel last 2 years heavy my timeline is long i dont expect anything big before 2026 but i am pretty sure intel goes above 100 by 2030 with foundry and future nodes 20A,18a ,14a . I want to point out that there is some guy who won a paper trade contest who is posting false information and other degrees of misinformation about Intel as fact. He has stated Intel's 18A is the same as TSMC 3nm and Intel is years behind. He has fabricated this using some random Internet guy's opinion based chart. Intel has not published node density for 18A. He then went so far as to post Intel's market materials and state that Intel 18A is going to have the same density as Intel 3, when the correct takeaway was Intel was saying that they would be equal to or better than anything in the industry with 18A. Anyway, he blocked me, which is fine. He didn't like his misinformation covers being pulled. It's fun to have opinions, but not when you make up artificial facts to support them.  Intel is good to invest in but you wont see a profit until 2027 . Just keep a close eye on the stock and buy little by little and not all at once . Patrick Gelsinger just spent like $500k buying intel stock this past week .

Here are two scenarios we know for a fact: The US is going to blow this factories before allowing them to fall in Chinese hands The top tech countries will make sure key personnel will be out of Taiwan the moment there are Chinese boots on the ground Taiwan is not Ukraine. The CEO said the company would blow the place up It's not Taiwan's tech that's cutting edge. The cutting edge of chip-making machines is based in the Netherlands. ASML supplies Taiwan with machines and anyone else who wants them. Taiwan's edge is in the fact that they have the entire supply chain already set up from start to finish. Everything from the delivery of raw materials to the skilled workers necessary. Any country can do what Taiwan does as long as they get ASML's machines. Taiwan just started doing it decades earlier so they're decades and tens of billions worth of investments ahead of anyone else. Which is also why the US keeps threatening ASML to not sell machines to China while begging for ASML's machines themselves. US is going to blow it up before Chinese can take it. Didn?셳 a US congressman say that?  That?셲 what TSMC and Taiwan has claimed it will do itself if China tries to invade. It?셲 honestly their best defense at the moment. Pretty sure TSMC would do that themselves. Devastating because it would obviously get leveled? The fab will be burned to the ground if the PLA ever attempt to occupy the island. they would need to run the gauntlet to even get close to the fab. The massive problem against a successful invasion the 180KM wide strait need to be crossed there are multiple small islands that are armed to the teeth along the strait to be cleared. any time they spend on clearing these island give time for three carrier strike groups to move from Japan to keelung Due to weather condition, there is only two months window every year to launch the armada Due to geography there are only a few landing sites that had large number of defensive fortifications prepared. When the landing craft survive all the antiship missiles and costal guns the troops would only have 100KM or so to go in land before facing mountains. The mountains range that goes across the island allow for hidden mobile launcher to do hit and run attacks. the east side of the island protected by the mountain range would be the base for resupply of the defender. practically the troops would need to land on the south and fight all the way up to Taipei on the northern end. Special forces would need to perform high risk helicopter drop mission ahead of the main troops I think 60 Minutes had an interview with the CEO of TSMC. He said if China invaded and attempted to seize the factory, they were prepared to blow the whole place up! It would be insanely stupid if he said anything else. Destroying TSMC is Taiwans equivalent to nuclear deterrence. They have to say they would blow it up, regardless of if they would actually do it. If China just made peace and struck a lucrative deal with taiwan instead, they?셝 have the same impact on the US without the fallout of war. They?셝 win global economic chess, in the chip manufacturing sector anyway. But noooOOOOOOooo What deal would you propose? Because i dont see it. The US (and Europe) wil always be willing to pay more for chips then China can. And China can't get Taiwans chip manufacturing tech either because China isn't getting any of ASLM's new machines (and had lost support on the old ones) Hence the point of the CHIPS act. E.g. in a shooting war w China, they?셪l jdam it as a last resort. Yeah, I?셫 building an emergency fund- in the event of any attack on Taiwan, I?셫 gonna do a run on tech like toilet paper during Covid- immediate upgrade on phone, computer. Imagine trying to buy a phone a month into this. It's not just about chips - Taiwan is a big buffer zone from which NK and China can bully SK and Japan.

I started putting it in yesterday 
Ill keep collecting every 30 that goes down
The proportion is about 10 this years return is not bad I think its worth investing in even if I take the risk of loss If ASML makes the machines that create chips what is the novel technology that differentiates fab companies capabilities from one another As I understand it a company like ASML creates the photolithography machines that create chips Intel and TSMC and other fabs use these machines to create chips If this is so what capabilities does TSMC have that separated them from the capabilities of Intel A while back Intel struggled to get past 14nm process and TSMC pulled far ahead in this capability If the capability to fab a certain size transistor is determined by the photolithography machines why didnt Intel have access to the same machines Another way to pose the question would bewhat propietary step in the fab process doesdid TSMC have any advantage over Intel in that is separate from the photolithography step in the fab process Process recipe development production line development and system selection system configurationscustomization and the actual transistor device  IC itself ASML primarily makes lithography systems that just a part of a long complicated process involving many different machines Each fab operator has their own process recipes that they develop for that production line for each system and process step Each of those systems including ASML are fairly complex machines with a long long list of settings and options Manufacturers will also offer different technologyfeature options application specialized configurations even customer specific customization process chemistries joint development advanced hardware features joint development process film etch etc and on and on The knobs to turn are vast So ASML doesnt just sell a 5nm machine The same ASML machine could make 10nm or 5nm depending on other steps in the process I work in a fab and I can absolutely concur that the recipes we run are insane Theres something like 15000 different recipes we can run and engineers are constantly tweaking tool settings and recipes to keep things up to spec and especially to make sure new product designs are possible on a large scale Not to mention the fact that each company is only as strong as its teams can be across shifts Different operators maintenance engineers and managers can add an insane amount of complexity for even the simplest recipes Former fab engineer here TLDR making advanced logic chips is terrifyingly complexunstable and lithography is only a piece of the puzzle It easy to picture chipmaking as hitting rinton a big fancy EUV machine and having a complete product come out In reality months of roundtheclock processing is needed to produce a single chip using a variety of process types to build 3D structures on an atomic scalelitho etch CVD PVD CMP inline metrology Wafers will be transferred from machine to machine in a clean room environment literally hundreds of times any failure of which can and will scrap the entire wafer Each process has to be continuously calibrated and adjusted to ensure consistency while also not affecting later manufacturing steps Litho is the gatekeeping tech for advanced chips but the secret sauce is in combining all of these overlapping process steps into a repeatable manufacturing process The structure of the chip that enables smaller transistors is also proprietary and has a lot of complex physics involved for bigger brains than mine look up GAAFinFET as an example if youe interested TSMC and others have entire fabs devoted to RD alone developing the next generation node technology separate from regular production fabs The RD fabs are some of the coolest places in the world if you ask me The Intel ones always have a slight skunkworks vibe to them compared to production lines as somebody who went from one to the other at least Disclaimer Ive spent time in some fabs so Ive seen things but am not a legit subject matter expert I am kind of speaking out my ass Photolithography is just one step in a very complex process Theres so much that goes into making chips I dont know where to begin again not the right expert When you build a chip not just every feature but every layer every mask every cleaning step requires incredible control and precision You may be able to draw the tiniest features with the tiniest photolithography machine but that doesnt mean theyll develop into features that work if you dont design them correctly and also build beforeduringafter properly Theres levels on levels of design process development process control manufacturing expertise This is more than just a photolithography exercise Every step that goes into the chip and interfaces with the chip demands physical chemical electrical perfection on this scale thats unimaginable to the naked eye AFAIK TSMC has more people scientists engineers production people technicians etc working more hours working for less money and for years have had better leadership driving them to lead the world specifically in stateoftheart chip manufacturing Which steps specifically are they outinnovating and outworking Intel Its a good question I dont know the answer But I am pretty sure its a lot more than just one TSMC can do it more economically It takes a lot of highly skilled people to run a fab plant and Taiwan has the education system for a work force and much lower wages TSMC is such a big player in Taiwan they can demand 70 hours a week from its workers The underlying technology is still owned by the US with a lot of the advanced research done in California When TSMC chairman was asked why not build a fab in California He answered hey surf too much TSMC also took huge risks with long term development when tin plasma generated EUV seemed like a dead end Off topic but Gigaphoton also has tin plasma generated EUV technology but nothing in production Additionally it rumored TSMC EUV machines are underperforming The light source is weaker than expected and requires longer exposure times Edit This means maybe TSMC is having a hard time making money and Gigaphoton decided it cant make money with the current level of EUV technology Its hard to expect Intel to commit The light source is weaker than expected and requires longer exposure times This was the basic problem that delayed EUV from becoming a commercial technology for over a decade I designed a part of a part of a part that was sold to ASML to go into the EUV machine in around 2007 or 2008 when the first generation RD EUV machines were already running at IBM and it was nearly a decade later that chips made with EUV started to appear in volume Its also the reason ASML had to buy Cymer rather than buy the EUV laser from them as an outside companyCymer on its own simply didnt have the financial backing to continue to develop their laser for years without being able to sell it ASML tech sets the lower limit on how small a feature can be They don design the features They don run the machines They don build the fabs or the materials that feed the stereo machines A working chip foundry requires all of that TSMC is better at the whole package than basically anyone else This is like asking if all chefs used the same oven would they not be differentiated Tsmc designs the process the opc recipe the spice models the stdcells the advanced packaging capability etc There are hundreds of steps that go into creating a chip Every machine has thousands of parameters that can be tuned for different performance this is called process optimization TSMC has lots of engineers who have a very good understanding of the intricacies of how to get the best performance out of each of these machines and how to get the best performance in combination from one process step to the next and to meet the unique customer specs Making a chip designed by apple requires a significantly different process from making one for Nvidia AMD or Qualcomm TSMC is good at making the ASML machines and others perform in the way they want to optimize for the specific features needed on different chips Theres also a ton of collaboration between companies like ASML and TSMC so its ot just TSMC doing it all alone they consult with ASML engineers to get the best performance out of the machines for their specific needs and ASML sharing this info with their other customers is legally forbidden An ASML machine running in an Intel fab is not going to be identical to one running in a TSMC fab Same goes for every other machine and process in either fab Every Home Depot sells you paints Will you be able to paint the sistine chapel Some others already offer some answers here is some more this is also from fab experience Lets assume each Intel and TSMC engineer is exactly equally smart None are better or worst here are some scenarios that will explain how they TSMC will pull ahead Experience and knowledge and just hard learning is going to tell the tale As already mentioned by others the ASML machines takes a long time to set upthis takes months being essentially roomsized machines that needs to be not just installed but then calibrated qualified and then put into production By having more capacity and continues to build more capacity TSMC is having more tool qualifying cycles to run through than Intel Each time they do this they just have be marginally better than the last time There are other somewhat soft factors as well TSMC has its fabs in Taiwans science parks where many other fabs reside This concentration of skill and knowledge means TSMC can gradually hire away the best and brightest and then filter them through its many fabs to place the most dedicated and knowledgeable workers in the most advanced fabs The concentration of fabs also means equipment manufacturers can stage spare parts and technical personal close by to support those science parks An equipment problem in the middle of the night will get fixed in the middle of the night While in the US the scatter of fabs means reliance on shipping replacement parts and difficult cases means flying a person in to fix the problem More fabs also mean more technical experts and support staff from equipment manufacturers not just ASML are constantly on site and those experts are better and more seasoned As mentioned above there will be problems to solve before the litho step So betterfaster problem solving elsewhere means less trouble for the engineering team running the AMSL tool Most likely we will never achieve this kind of single industry concentration in the US Another factor is education Taiwan having staked its niche in semiconductors can afford to have specialist education This economic niche has become de facto industrial and education policy for students that want to chase this field In the US electricalchemical engineers have a lot of other industry options In fact for the TSMC Arizona fab the complain coming from Taiwanese workers and management is that the US counterparts dont work as hard but the US workers really do have other options and dont have to stay in the semi field This hits Intel as well also with an Arizona fab but also hits every US based Intel site TSMC can promote from within and hire young engineers to train from the bottom up And now you have entrenched professionals that keeps that knowledge and experience that will only concentrate more for TSMC over time Once you get to this point it goes beyond the production cycle of not just a fab but production cycle of future employees within a nation Now the cumulative outcome Keep in mind all this talk of better or worse doesnt have to dramatically better or worse They can each be somewhere around 05 and that will still be an insurmountable Making chips is not 100 there will be bad chips due to errors so every percentage of yield matters TSMC makes millions of wafers a year The organization of wafer is typically 2025 wafers in a lot Many lots makes up a batch of orders Many orders for the same chip constitute a device type similar devices form a device family The time and material for processing wafers is going to be fairly constant Falling short may even mean starting new lots to fill production thus costing more time and labor If problem solving and learned improvement is giving single  differences accumulated knowledge from more capacity and seeing more cases is giving single digit differences and add in education and locality Single digits of yield improvement will then mean a few more good chips per wafer and is millions of dollars of difference per contract Even if you have two cadres of employees equally smart the company that runs through more cycles will get better faster And the company that pulls up its production yield faster stays in the most profitable times of new product cycle longer That is what translates fractions of  differences to become an incremental advantage multiplied by the endless 24 hour production cycle Best answer in here thanks So all a litho machine really does is shine light though a reticle The wafer will be coated with a lacquer like material called a photoresist that will cure where the UV light shines on it Then the uncured resist is washed away then the wafer is etched to remove material from the areas not protected by the resist The design of the reticle is typically left to each fab and will be different for not just every chip but every layer of every chip ASML does not own the reticle designs They would of course heavily consult with any fab on each reticle design to optimize the litho tool for that process Making a chip looks like Wafer fabrication  depositionLithoEtchPolishLithoIon Implantation for the main doped layers where the transistors aredepositionLithoEtchPolishdepositionLithoEtch until you create all the layers necessary for the chip The exact architecture of the devices the masks the materials thickness of layers the tool recipes these are all the difference between TSCM vs Samsung vs Intel its all about the orginazation within the company and the circumstances they created compare it to a taxi service they use the same cars from the same manufacturer but the service they provide is much better then their compatitors but still using that same brand of cars ASML gives you the ability to make chips you design the chip Every printer prints text but you still need a writer to write the text Basically masterchef All the chefs have access to the same fancy top of the line equipment and more or less the same ingredients One of the chefs knows you need to let an ingredient sit at a slightly lower temperature for 5 seconds before bringing it to a boil and infusing seasoning before heating everything up will produce 10 x the flavor All the other chefs can do pretty well but that last bit of knowhow is what separates the winner from the rest of the competition There are thousands of ways to get to an end goal but you rely on intuition and experience to extract that last 1  which gives you an edge You can either brute force the problem by working people overtime to compensate intuition with experience or have a mix of the two ASML make printers Fabs  foundries come up with what they need to print and provide the material to print on and with Transistors consist of many etched layers and gates consist of several transistors and each fab designs their own transistors and gate layouts as well as higher level analog component libraries standard blocks like high speed block RAM etc ASML are an essential part without high enough print resolution nothing else works But theye far from the main differentiator The simplest analogy I can think of If I give you all of the exact same tools and equipment that a Michelin chef usesits not going to make you a Michelin chef Process parameters often called recipes are trade secret and are just as important as the equipment used Eg Ive been on a lot of factory tours and theyre happy to show you around and let you look at the various lines The equipment isnt the skill or the secret  the process control is Back to your OP theres also a question of scale The entire chain of processes and equipment needed to go from silicon wafer to packaged chip is enormous and quite extreme by most metrics ASML creates some of the equipment but by no means all or even most of it Im not a trader Its a bite Monolithic Power Systems EVP sells shares worth over 599k Nvidia the new God of Bull Qualcomm  We did not expect to receive product revenues from Huawei beyond the current calendar year Long QCOM Report Intel Bought All of ASMLs HighNA EUV Machines for 2024 Ive got friends in Litho and Ill simply say that this move makes a lot of sense once you really crunch the numbers and understand both the capabilities of these machines and the costs of process flows with multiple lithography passes TSMC said theyre confident in multiple exposure self aligned patterning techniques Intel said the same thing when EUV was first being introduced and boy were we wrong This wasnt done on a whim No I wont elaborate This comment is honestly my exact thought its uncanny how similar the situation is Ill be curious to see if TSMC has issue with their 16nm roadmap and if yields end up being poor Theres certainly some derisk based on chiplets etc but still itll be interesting to see if the same mistake is made Im about the farthest thing from a technical person on this topic as possible just a casual investorobserver This is a good move by Intel and very risk also Theyve fallen behind and they must make a huge bet to catch up and take over TSMC Really look forward on how the competitive landscape will change after 2030 Very good move by Intel getting those machine soon as possible will accelerate their node progression faster Intel didnt think they needed EUV we all know what happened TSMC is saying they dont need highEUV why would it be different this time around I am seeing Patrick Gelsinger is making the right moves rn Doing whatever they can to win back the market Only time will tell if the efforts pay off in the future not sure exactly why this matters but i know this is probably a good thing It does really matter because Intel can progress their next gen nodes faster which means we can get better products at the end with better nodes which not only provide better performance but also efficiency makes sense they got no money left it is a good move They win a contract with apple or nvidia it

is pairing with rising prospects for consumer demand though TSMC Chief Executive Officer CC Wei has cautioned about the pace of any recovery The company shares soared to an alltime high in April as it remains in an enviable position to benefit from the rise of AI technology being Nvidia sole manufacturer for the most advanced training chips TSMC also fabricates semiconductors for Apple Inc which

2024-05-10," US buys 92% of its cutting-edge chips from the Taiwanese manufacturer . US Commerce Secretary says if China seized TS The Arizona, Kumamoto, and German plants are there to ensure military supply won't be under blockade once the war starts. Az for instance is massive. The announced they would build one factory in like 2021. Then the chips act passed and they ok now we build 2. Then last year they said just kidding we meant 3. Right now there are 12k+ builders working on site every single day. If. It's also for dissuasion, since Xi would know we still have options. US has threatened to flatten TSMC in such scenarios. They will not let them own/occupy it. ITT: everyone is a geopolitical expert While they say adults don't play pretend as much as kids, online, our qualifications are l make-believe. The TSMC facilities would be the first thing destroyed if war broke out. Taiwan isn't a stalemate it's a hostage crisis.  This is why the US government is investing so heavily in Intel. it would devastate the world economy The greatest trick China every pulled was making US-industry dependent on it The chip assembly happens primarily in Taiwan. However, the essential components necessary for said assembly, are shipped from elsewhere. It makes no sense for China to ?쐔ake over??TSMC because it won?셳 really accomplish anything, other than piss off the entire world. It?셲 not like TSMC will be able to continue to produce chips, after the components are no longer getting shipped in. Not saying that China is not going to try to do it??Just saying it makes no sense. Edit: Here you go, guys: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_industry_in_Taiwan Instead of ""assembly"", I should had said ""Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing, design, and packaging"". They wouldn?셳 attack Taiwan because of TSMC. They would attack it because they believe it?셲 theirs and part of China and Winnie the poo is getting old and their economy sucks. Everyone is gearing up for war and I?셫 willing to bet China attacks Taiwan within the next 5-10 years. Chip assembly? You mean packaging? That doesn?셳 happen at semiconductor fabs, only fabricating the dies (hence the name fab). The silicon used to create wafers are not uniquely special either. You have no idea what you?셱e talking about. Would Be absolutely devastating for China, because we would use the full might of our military to protect a strategic resource. They don?셳 want that smoke. How to summon an astroturfer? Simple. Chant.. ""Taiwan Number One"" Try it. LOL, your point was proven pretty quickly. The corollary to your method is: How to make a CCP astroturfer go away? Say ""Tiananmen Square"". nah, anything remotely related to china is already astroturfed pretty heavily on reddit. there's been a marked shift of reddit's overall opinion on china and russia since the start of the year and it's not hard to imagine why And that's why Taiwan happens to be one of those places where the righteous fight for democracy and human rights is very important and must be supported, unlike places like Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan where, as it happens, freedom and democracy isn't necessary.  The issue was obvious many years ago and totally avoidable . Intel chip fab guy says it will teach us a badly-needed lesson about our unending greed and short-sightedness . AMD's gaming graphics business looks like it's in terminal decline Another doomsdayer. Yeah this problem extends to all luxury items this year. Consumers are out of spare cash. I really have not followed GPU releases for a few years but no matter what your thoughts on AMD / nvidea are isn???this pretty terrible if true? Nvidea without any real competition sounds like a nightmare. I honestly stopped building PCs after I got a 980ti for free because a friend won their scavenger hunt thing in Orlando. Every year I see nvidea charging more and more for their entry level GPUs and it???wild. Between their pricing and inability to prevent resellers from price gouging actual consumers, I???hate for them to have more market share. Exactly.   I have an RTX card and yet I am actively rooting for intel and AMD because without competition Nvidia will gladly gouge people without remorse. People rooting for team green are dumber than dirt.  Intel and AMD would do the same thing if they could btw, all corporations are the same, but they don???have the market clout to pull it off. And yet every gaming console runs AMD Not switch but that a hybrid Agreed that this is doomsaying. Graphics cards are more than for gaming. AI is becoming the new Bitcoin mining for graphics cards. Nvidia's company value rising above $2 trillion has nothing to do with gaming as far as the market is concerned. A company installed an AI server that is supposed to detect weapons in security camera feeds at our place and it's just a Linux PC with a 4090. It's just a beta, but we're fixin' to see a flood of AI startup companies. A rising tide lifts all ships and AMD graphics cards may find a place in that market. If you're waiting to buy a graphics card, you may want to do it sooner than later as the prices may be shooting up again. AMD earnings are way down and their own estimates are not looking good, PC manufacturers are getting cold feet. Waiting for the tide to rise might not be a game they can afford to play. Which is bad news for consumers, and makes me sad as the proud owner of a kickass AMD Zephyrus G14. It will be interesting to see the future of gaming/graphics. I half expect Nvidia to slowly drop the market in favour AI development. Even if they don't exit the market, I'd expect a lot of their future investment will be more on the AI side and less on graphical horsepower. I bought an AMD graphics card for the first time ever last year. I'm still a happy camper. The problem with online forums and news outlets trying to push this story is that people who are easily influenced believe it and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy as people start to get scared. AMD's gaming graphics business looks like it's in terminal decline | PC Gamer Terminal like an airport, not enough flyers, but there will always be customers People been saying AMD/ATI are gonna go stop making GPUs for decades, and then they drop a banger card that normal people can afford, and everyone loves them again. Their problem is they lack a flagship 4090-competitor. This is really silly. All markets are on a downturn right now, and when markets start tanking, ""frivolous"" consumer spending is always going to take a huge hit. AMD is fine. Their earnings generally are super strong, and they've made huge progress with both RDNA 2 and RDNA 3, even though the latter was disappointing compared to how great RDNA 2 actually was.  AMD has a huge lineup of APU's coming out which rely heavily on their graphics technology . Strix point and Strix Halo are going to be fucking *huge* in mobile . It's the major market shift I've been eagerly awaiting for at least 5 years . We're about to see an era where mobile graphics are mostly integrated . I'm not at all worried about AMD's gpu division. I'm far more worried about Intel entirely collapsing as a company, especially after *their* earnings report. AMD is smart too, they are only launching a few mid performance GPUs next gen until they can compete with Nvidia. They are doing fine but need to improve their upscale tech to something closer to DLSS. These people seem to think there???room for unlimited growth smh I don???play as much now that Covid is in the rear view mirror. I scored a reference 6800 XT in 2020 or 2021 and it totally works for my occasional gaming needs. Hope they stick through it and make waves with the 8000 series. If you're gonna give me budget performances I expect budget prices. R&D research is expensive. AMD thought they were going to be able to offset this with AI and the inability to ship cards to China really hurt them. AMD took a 48% decline in revenue in their gaming division in the first quarter of 2024. The decision to forgo high end cards in the RDNA 4 lineup was basically waving the white flag to NVIDIA. If you thought the price to performance for NVIDIA was bad wait until they have nothing more powerful than a 60 series to compete with. Shareholders expect results and dividends. Shedding off the discrete graphics market and focusing on the CPU/iGPU makes the most financial sense.  AMD's 12gb 4080 is bad news for the consumer, writes Ars Ars Arsene Wenger . Nothing would really stand against nvidia, he says . They can't compete on features, and resist competing on price, so... naw. amd has always been and always will be a good buy for the budget minded buyers. will be a good buy for the budget minded buyers.  AMD cards such as the R9 Fury X had reached legacy status after 5 years . Meanwhile, old GTX cards still receive game-ready drivers 9 years later, not just security updates . If you've seen the steam survey there are not many people that want AMD cards. The consumer has spoken and would rather pay $1000 for Nividia. AMD does great in the console/mobile sector and with cpus but they just don't hold a candle to Nvidia graphics on PC. I cannot fathom why so many people on this sub want nvidia to have a monopoly on the GPU market. Nvidia monopoly (they are, admittedly, close enough to it already) would be horrible news for us My issue with AMD has always been stability...I used them for a few generations but with the 6000 and 7000 series I had some pretty gnarly issues near launch so ended up having to return and go with Nvidia. It's sad because the hardware was good but they always seemed rush to launch. My RX 6900 would get stuck in boot loops, rev fans to 100% and start overheating on boot up and then calm down...random freezes and crashes in games or just hard lock. RX7900 was a bit more stable but i'd get a lot of game crashes. I'll try the 8000 series again but unless they can launch somewhat stable it's a hard sell for most people. They can???catch up on features but they used to be at least way cheaper for similar performance as rtx cards but this last gen they threw up price/performance out the window too. Why would I even buy amd card right now when rtx card which is $50-$100 more can destroy the competition I love my 7900XT it is a great bang for buck. The build quality is very nice. And I can run anything I throw at it with ease. Also was about 400??less than a 4080 at the time. Would for sure buy AMD again. Already have to disagree. They aren't going anywhere and Nvidia seems poised to shoot itself in the foot About Intel Its collecting Youll feel it later Broadcoms 2024 stock forecast Why is the highest target price estimated at 179118 Broadcoms 2024 Stock Outlook Why the maximum target price is expected to be 179118
 Despite being just a humble CPU socket, AMD 'boldly suggests' AM4 has 'legendary status' AM4 is legendary. I upgraded to AM4 when the first Ryzen came out (I was on FM2+ before that). I upgraded to a 5000 series CPU at the end of last year, only reason I got a new board was because I wanted 2 nvme slots. Otherwise I could have kept the one I had. (Friend got a nice upgrade though, game him the board, CPU and the 1660 for free as I took pity on him still having an A8 CPU and it gave me an aneurysm watching him play WoW at sub 30 fps) AM4 is in fact legendary I went from a 2700x in 2019 to a 5800x3d In 2023. It???astounding in this age of planned obsolescence. It's the 1080 Ti of CPU sockets AM4, 775, 1366... all legendary. Among others, mostly older ones. I rocked a 1366 motherboard with an i7-970 for 12 years! It was a damn reliable CPU. I've been calling AM4 legendary for years, where's my article?  AM4 is the best consumer socket of all time . I'm not sure there's ever been a socket that was as upgradable as AM4 . Guarantee in 10 years there will still be people rocking AM4, and the crazy thing is, it'll probably still be pretty decent . Nothing but the truth here  Socket AM4 had an entire 5 generations of CPUs on a single socket . I personally started out with a 28nm Bristol Ridge A12-9800 APU (pre Zen) and ended with a 7nm Vermeer 5800X3D CPU . edit:  More recent games that make use of DX12 DirectStorage and other types of asset streaming started having performance issues like stuttering when moving across open worlds . Later generations of AM4 CPUs are capable of a lot more total PCIE bandwidth and don't run into the same bottleneck . I had 3 diff gen CPUS in my AM4. Yeah I would vote it to be legendary!!! Even if it goes down will the US just leave it like that lol If its cheap you should like it and put it in If youre going to hit it you should buy something else Have AMD GPUs mainly caught up to Nvidia? I moved to AMD after Intel decided innovating is over-rated, I moved over in Zen 4 and I won???be going back to Intel. Nvidia has annoyed me to over the years with their practices so it has me heavily leaning to moving to AMD for GPU as well. I plan to wait for 9800X3D to release and then do my build, I???like to move over and try out AMD GPUs, I would wait for RDNA 4 to release as well, my choice would between 8900 XTX and 4070 Ti.  I play in 1440p 144hz, main titles are FS 2020, Call of Duty, and older titles like Civ V and TF2 . I want to play more single player titles on next build like RDR2, Cyberpunk, and Alan Wake 2 . Unfortunately just had to give up my Zen 4 build so can???see how those games Dont overthink it, AMD has better raster for money, NVIDIA has the premium upscaling and better RT. Buy the best you can afford/want, brands can go fuck themselves. I honestly hardly ever use raytracing, always just tanked my fps and made the game unenjoyable cause of that. 7900 xt ~ 4070 ti, 7900 xtx ~ 4080. The main loss of AMD vs Nvidia, Nvidia is better at raytracing. The problem with AMD vs Nvidia on the next gen??all indications are AMD will only make 8000 up to mid range and no 8900 xtx. We will have a better idea once the gpus are released. Hopefully, AMD catches up with raytracing. Amd also doesn't have an answer to the 4900. For the absolute best you have to pick Nvidia. Personally I went for the 7900xtx with a 7800x3d. Imo the best value at the high end. If I was buying today I might get the GRE instead of the XTX. RT, DLSS, DLDSR, power efficiency, encoding, AI, etc. Saying RT is the only area AMD needs to catch up in is disingenuous. Don't get me wrong, I really wish there was more competition. No The only answer. The rest of this thread is pure delusion If you dont need RT or DLSS yes, if you do then no. On the low end DLSS has beats AMD, on the top end DLSS wont matter as much but AMD cant keep up with RT. But if your getting a top end GPU and dont play RT games then yes. Saying that AMD do have a lot of up sides, they tend to cost less and have more VRAM. There's options like the 7900 GRE that stand out as value kings. Also RT is something people want until they use it, unless you have a top end GPU the FPS hit is massive. RT will half your FPS if not more with PT. edit no low to mid range GPU can use RT, always amazed by people who post saying there getting a 4060 for RT. You know there not going to do a second post full of regret after they get sub 60FPS~ Yes and no. Currently have a 4090 but had a 7900XTX as well as an XT and have had 10???of AMD and NVIDIA cards over the years. I will say this. Nvidias drivers are better. Plain and simple. I like AMD???Radeon UI and their price better but I ran into more problems with AMD cards. If you??켩 on a budget AMD is not a bad choice, but NVIDIA is still the premium option imo. DLSS is so good that AMD really needs to improve to be in contention. In my opinion, of course. And all the signs are that they've abandoned the high end, and will just be targeting low to mid end in coming generations. Help Please! My litecoin txn got split into 3 inuts and 2 outputs and sent more than I wanted to send  I had sent some litecoin to a crypto casino site from my ledger and the casino received the amount I intended but in the same transaction, it split and send 9x the amount to another address which I have no idea who it belongs to but its not me . I heard about UXTO on BTC and it's supposed to return the change That's a change address. It's your address, in your wallet. Litecoin always does that, because the sum of the input UTXO amounts will always be greater than the spending amount The change should go to a new address, also on your Ledger.  Reddit was my last resort after trying to get ledger chat support and failing cause it was closed . But I just restarted my computer and now the txn has corrected it self from the full 10x what I wanted to send back to the original 1x . I only take Litecoins out of the crypto casino. Never put them in. Just a few days ago Theres still more to the bottomWhat do you meanThings like buying underground

Unfortunately this scholarship is only for Bumiputeras (because MARA) :( the JPA one is for all! i can awnser inquiries about marine & environmental science Aik, I'm pretty sure I already added you mmmmm but it seemed like I hadn't. Thanks! I added you under ""Science & Research"" (likely need to refine the fields/areas) i would love to help the young nyets that want to pursue their studies in human resource management! im currently a final year student (diploma) and it would be great to be one of the volunteers to provide general insights to this course :) Thank you, added! Is there pharmacist or is it counted inside medicine? There isn't one yet, I'm afraid :( Hi, I'm currently a Year 2 veterinary medicine student in Malaysia that has also graduated from Diploma in Animal Health & Husbandry from UPM Kampus Bintulu. As someone that has gone through the vet school interview process more times than I'm proud of, I'd love to volunteer Great! Shall I tag you for animal health and husbandry and vet school interview? i?셫 working as an IT Consultant on automation stuff, be happy to help to answer some questions I can help with education & TVET (technical & vocational education). Hello! Hope it's not too late. Would like to throw my hat in for people interested in mass communications, business writing, and journalism. Specific industries I was in include Banking, as well as annual report and sustainability report writing. I graduated from UPM, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine.
From my experience, there's quite a lot of people interested in this field, but do not know where to begin. Currently working as a feed formulator in livestock industry. Will be happy to help answer some questions. I work in a biomedical research institute with both wet lab research and clinical trial (testing treatment intervention on humans) experiences, but I studied and currently working overseas so maybe I can only help with the ""what do you do in your labs/office?"" etc questions if anyone wanna know about it. Im in Supply Chain as system guy. But have done IT ops (helpdesk, infra, some cybersecurity and project implementations). IT varies greatly from industry to industry, in house / MSP or even software (programmer) / hardware (IoT, pc troubleshoot). Hit me up if you're confused as to which IT part you want to pursue IT (Quality Assurance; Manual/Automation), would be happy to help anyone who's interested! I can also refer to some IT-related internships. Internship allowance is RM3k a month. Hey there, great initiative here OP! I hope I'm not too late. I'm a software engineer and would be glad to share whatever I can with anyone interested in pursuing this career. Anyone interested in Astronomy PhDs? Hi there, PhD student in Cancer research in UM here. I can help if there is still need. Degree and PhD loca, Masters, overseas, mainly wet lab stuff, infectious diseases and cancer research, with a bit of primary care research. Not sure if it would clash with u/cryinginlibrary . But don't mind helping. Micron Technology's university recruiter contacted but got rejected later midnight. On Wednesday at 4:30 pm, a university recruiter at Micron contacted me and had a few questions regarding the job specifies and told me that she would forward all the information to the Hiring Manager and that the next interview would be with HM only. On Thursday at 2:40 in the early morning, I got an automatic reply from Workday that they decided not to move forward with your application. Is this a part of the normal process or a system glitch? Has anyone had this kinda experience? What happened next? Would appreciate your insights. Thanks. Could mean a lot of things, anything from normal to a glitch. Personally, I would send a quick follow up about appreciating the process and looking for other opportunities. If it's a mistake the recruiter will tell you, if not they will accept your thanks and maybe look for new roles.  Not sure if the HM rejected it the day itself after the recruiter informed her/him about me . Recruiter told that the next interview would be with HM only . So, I thought they were interested . Got to love the job search. Even in rejection we must lick the boot. Reminds me of animal house. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qdFLPn30dvQ If you got rejected no big deal. Your resume gets you call backs so that?셲 good. Keep pushing, it?셪l happen. Yeah, man! Let?셲 hope I get something from them. I have been struggling to secure a job and trying to stand out from the crowd. But seems like the tech market isn?셳 improving soon. Did you apply to more than one position by any chance? Yes, I did. But I was only contacted for a specific position. You have had a similar experience? Micron is weird. Have had recruiters contact me on their own based on findind my profile in their ""system"", and after I sent an initial response, it's just full ghost mode. I had their initial response and a call from the same recruiter as well. But I think it?셲 just the system who triggers the automated response after they filter out the candidates and contact them. There can be a situation where everyone gets the same automated response and still got personal responses from the recruiters.

Sales increased by 34.3% in March, buoyed largely by appetite for AI semiconductors . Global smartphone industry returned to growth over the first three months of the year, including in the highly competitive Chinese market . US-traded shares were up 3% in New York in early trading on Friday. Hsinchu-based TSMC weathered a year of muted demand for personal electronics last year, which Nvidia Corp.?셲 highly sought-after AI chips helped make more tolerable. Now the AI boost is pairing with rising prospects for consumer demand, though TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei has cautioned about the pace of any recovery.

Moon before elections Wonder how much of this was Apple increasing orders. Last year, Apple ??which TSMC's SEC filing calls 'Customer A' ??accounted for 25% of TSMC's revenue and paid TSMC $17.52 billion. Meanwhile, Nvidia ??which Nystedt believes is designated as Customer B in the filing ??paid TSMC $7.73 billion and accounted for 11% of TSMC's net revenue in 2023.

2024-05-13,ASML shares via ABN Amro investing Hoi allemaal Does anyone have an experience with buying ASML shares directly through ABN Amro investing I started using their services  Self Directed Investing and I am curious what are proscons of doing it there fees do not seem to be that much higher comparing to other places and it quite conveniant for usage Using it to buy mostly VWCE Now would like to start investing directly into ASML Any suggestion on this Cheers The issue is not just transaction costs but service costs that are charged for holding your product Transaction costs omestic shares   005 on the value of the order per orderIf you bought 10 times at 000 shares it will cost you 5 in transaction costs Service Costs 2 of the value of your investment portfolio From 00000 the service costs are 012 from 00000 the service costs are 006So 0000 investment will cost you 00 per year to hold In 5 years if you sell at same value that would be 150transaction cost  500service cost 650ASML I switched out of ABN AMRO when I saw the service costs on my account statement As comparison the same on DeGiro would cost you 90transaction cost  0service cost 90ASML hmmm yea I understand but since my portfolio is still small I ignored this for now but def will have it in mind Thanks for clarifying So you suggest DeGiro Any other app I have it its not much different than buying an ETF ABN charges 5 euros  005 order sum per order not exactly cheap unless youre planning to only place a few orders You could also consider a sector ETF that has it as a significant portion

2024-05-14,"Bought it to invest for a century Stop motels and go up to the hotel Good news is out Its time to escape the resistance line I have half my portfolio in INTC Tell me why I'm wrong ?쁿 Their 18A process is best in class Their x86 chips will be way more efficient on 18A The ARM chips on 18A will be more efficient than competitors Their GPUs are only a generation or two behind Nvidia. Their AI platform (gaudi) is already more efficient that Nvidia and is only a generation or two behind in terms of raw horsepower. If we think about compute in general let's say 33% cloud, 33% HPC/AI, 33% edge. Right now Intel is a major player in all 3 markets. Xeon isn't going anywhere and once 18A process starts moving volumes it will be such a huge jump in performance that all these cloud vendors that have been extending lifecycles will finally have a reason to upgrade. Gaudi will become more competitive over time as companies start to realize that nuclear power stations for data centers are not really a good idea. The power density required for nvidias chips just isn't sustainable.  ARM is a big threat to Intels x86 market but it's also a big opportunity for Intel foundry . Apple really has been excelling using the latest process technologies to build more efficient edge compute . Intel with their state of the art 18A coming online around the world will soon having companies lined up for ARM production . Intel GPUs are getting more and more competitive with Nvidia every generation. In terms of gaming I see them becoming a more and more of a thorn in nvidias side, but that's just GPUs...  If all goes well in the world then Intel will continue to play a major role in the global compute market . Intel's new factories become the only way to keep our world moving forward . I just don't see why nvda can be possibly worth 20x Intel . Already Biden is escalating the trade war with China. Imagine if it gets to the point where the US decides to permanently dismantle TSMC's entire manufacturing capacity then imagine what that will do to global chip supply. All it would take is one wrong move by China to seize control over the strait and USA will undoubtedly destroy the manufacturing before letting it fall under Chinese control. Join WSB Discord welcome to the club though I don't know how big your portfolio is I have six figures in it and been red for years now, cheers to next year lol! lmao yall reported me to redditcares, don't ever change WSB bags heavy ? I exited few days ago after saw the post that in 1999 the stock was the same $29 Worked at intel for 10 years from 2008, their issue is not technology, it is culture. They don?셳 have the right attitude for doing this. They need a leader who can inspire them to go the extra mile when they are building things. Imagine we had one of the biggest bull runs and semiconductor cycles in history and Intel didn?셳 budge since 1999 without accounting for inflation I hate this stock so much. I listened to my brother and decided DCA was the plan when it dipped. His portfolio is 100% fucking INTC. Now I sell covered calls to degens trying to break even. Which we're getting close to. How is being 2 generations behind a competitor a good thing??? Because their stock doesn't grow. On paper Intel isn't like, an awful company or anything. Their revenue is still humongous and they've got their own fabs, a well-established brand name, etc.  Whatever offerings they have in the major spaces right now are seen as inferior, overly costly, or on the way out compared to what their competitors are promising in the near future . Maybe that changes in the future, but it's not something I'd bet on at these prices . That being said, they should probably see an easy retrace to the Come back in late 2025 Is the short selling over Not yet There is a long way to goIll only see 2030 and hold it Micron executive sells over 49 million in company stock YesMicron shares are up today due to their rosy 2025 growth predictionSanjay are todays Nostradamus Pro Research Wall Street dives into ARM Holdings market potential Nvidia can it hit 600 by Dec2025 6 months ago there were chip demand warnings and now ridiculous news If inflation is draining demand for computers where are all these chips going to be installed Remember all the technology hopes and dreams in the early 2000s that were crushed and held back for years 300b added in 1 week 26b revenue net profit 3B what a mess Hopium levels are over 9000 1T 26B in revenue The bubble is real Nvidia is going to offload a whole bunch of stock today So keep on buying retailers Yup  nothing is impossible with latest Nvidia Messiah AI no more global conflicts wars hunger pandemic and crisis with AI just buy Nvidia stocks and the world will end up as Heaven Rambus to Present at Upcoming Investor Conferences Short 39 target Recruitment companies vs ASML website When applying to ASML, is there any difference between applying through recruitment companies such as Trinamics and applying directly through the ASML website? So, is there a possibility that one is better than the other in terms of getting a job? Not in terms of compatibility with the position, but for other reasons such as sponsorship, immigration, contract, etc. Through a company means you will be on a contract via that company, instead of a full ASML employee. Get the job directly if you can. And you wouldn't have ASML's benefits/bonuses for moving and other stuff. Besides the people analyzing your application in the end are going to be the same. I suggest applying directly on ASML's website and attaching a very well crafted motivation letter, DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THIS A nicely prepared motivation letter can make a huge difference in making you stand out. After that you have, of course, to do well in the interviews I'm not knowledgeable about differences in sponsorship/immigration but can comment a little.  In general you want to be applying directly if possible for reasons u/FireHeartMaster detailed . However it can be slow... and if you know somebody in the company, ask them to refer you . If you've already applied yourself then you are ineligible for referral .  There are also outsource/farmout agencies that have people or whole teams embedded within ASML . The only main advantage I see from this over direct-employment is the potential to work remotely . I see that about remote working it can vary a lot. In my department we have a colleague with an external contract but they do everything the same way everyone else does. They have to come to the office as much as everybody. Besides, the whole department is in hybrid work Remind myself to get back to this later* In short: Recruitment companies are gonna rip you off but can offer an easier way to get in Recruitment companies are mostly just leeches. The only reason to use one is that for some positions (mostly starters) ASML wants to use these companies to reduce risk, i.e. they can fire you without a hassle within the first year. And the recruitment manager might be a bit more active/responsive/helpful with prep for you if you're new to the process. If however there is the possibility to get a direct contract with ASML, always pick this option. The contract is so much better, it's not even close. Apply directly with ASML through their website. That way you get a position working directly for ASML which means you will get a far better salary and benefits.  Before I got my current job at ASML, I was contacted by a recruiter for a telephone interview . She told me 35k was what they were considering for the position . She did not say they were a recruiting agency, but I can just guess so, because I was hired for a very similar role for 60k . ASML has a hiring freeze (actually a growth freeze) for 2024. Which means they won't be growing, so new positions will only open if people are leaving the company. Best idea is to focus your CV's closer to the end of the year. And I second the motivation letter together with your CV. Your application will not be processed if you do not include a motivation letter. Slowly Its a real deal Still 7 sniff sniff Lets go TSMC says can make next generation chips without ASML's new machine Sounds like posturing since intel received the new machines first.

2024-05-15,"2024 NASDAQMU New Product Launch Announcement three dog stocks AMD Publishes Latest AMD FSR 2 & 3 Supported Games List [Updated as of May 10, 2024. Latest updates in bold] Cyberpunk 2077 - Upcoming At this rate it feels like it will never come (or at least maybe once their agreement with Nvidia ends) Yeah it's not coming. Fsr 3 has been out for over half a year, it should already be there Main weakness of FSR is you cannot swap the latest version into past games like with DLSS. For context, RDR2 got FSR 2.2 update in March 2024 and for over a year it was stuck on 2.0. When FSR 3.1 comes out, I cannot swap it in the game and need to wait for game devs to do it, if they ever. There are so many games on 2.0 and 2.1 which will never be updated to 2.2/3.1. In contrast, due to the ability to swap dll files, you can get the latest improvement on Day 1 in all DLSS games. This gives DLSS a massive advantage. There is also no way to customise the render resolution of FSR like you can with DLSS Tweaks. 7900XTX can easily handle over 100 FPS in RDR2 at 85% render scale but we are stuck with 67% in quality mode. With DLSS, you can use render scale 85% and even 100% for DLAA The above features are quality of life improvements which should have been there from Day 1, considering Nvidia had them and AMD knew about them. Also where is FSR 3.1? We need an update here because Nvidia next gen cards are 5 months away and will likely come with more improvements to DLSS. FSR 3.1 should fix the dll swap issue and if you want a higher internal resolution you can combine VSR with FSR. Obviously still not as good as having the option to select the internal resolution percentage, but still better than nothing. Is it bad that I just don't care for FSR? Like XESS looks substantially better and even more so if you drop the 1.3 DLL into other games. There are only 2 things I miss moving from NVIDIA to AMD Driver consistency and support for older games DLSS XESS has gotten to the point where I'm pretty happy not using DLSS these days as it's very VERY close Where 3.1?? This means nothing until they fix their upscaler with 3.1. I'm more interested in that than the frame gen. Ratchet and Clank the only one listed as 3.1?? That's disappointing, I guess it will be a long time until general availability. It's less Ratchet and more so Nixxes. So that means Ratchet, Horizon, Tsushima and future Playstation ports will get FSR 3.1. At this rate, might as well wait for fsr3.1 for cyberpunk. Seeing Eve Online in that list cracked me up, I can't remember a time when I ever got less than 100fps. I think they're only adding it as a marketing point, just to slap the sticker on the game. I wonder why DCS World isn't here. I'm still wondering what happened to the fabled FSR 3.1 which AMD announced over 6 weeks ago. Their marketing clowns are so inept that any anticipation generated by the announcement has long gone. Even the updated list of games only shows one game planning to implement it. They should at least try to get the other 'coming soon' games to implement 3.1 instead of sticking with 3.0. Nothing happened. It's been announced for Q2 2024. Are we on June 30th yet? No, we are not. I don???see Rust in this list yet! Even though Monster Hunter Sunbreak is not on the list, I still find AFMF giving me great frame gen experience. Went from 4K Max 110 FPS to 180 FPS on my 6800XT. Can someone explain to me, what the size of dots mean? Shame Capcom hasn't updated the FSR on their RE Engine games. Because of that even used nVidia cards are more interesting than new AMD ones now. AMD's better value ? Gone. You get DLSS, RT, FG featured in way more games and looking better. On older 20/30 series even AMD's frame gen works better than on their own cards can you freaking believe this. Congrats AMD for shooting yourselves in the foot. If you're gaming definitely buy AMD CPUs ... but not their GPUs period. Shifting from red to green myself right now, good bye AMD discrete GPUs until they wake up again.

Well to all the nay say'ers, saying AMD won't fix or doesn't care about the Fallout issue... The new driver released today has the issue at the top of their known issues list. Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas may fail to launch.[Hotfix pending verification] So to me that means they are are actually on top of this issue, and have a solution coming. Props to them. I'm glad AMD isn't just pointing fingers, I know it's an old game but it's an issue that only came up on the last driver update, it certainly needs a driver fix. There is a mod that fixes this problem, and if you want to play Fallout New Vegas, I encourage you to use a lot of fixes to make it run correctly, I play fallout new Vegas without problem with my 6900xt. I also advise you not to use 4k mods, they create a lot of stuttering. there is also a problem with the game, impossible to use anti aliasing if I use my game in French.. And it has nothing to do with AMD, but I never managed to find any solution. a guide to optimizing the game => https://vivanewvegas.github.io/ a guide to improving the visual aspect of the game => https://salamand3r.fail/new-vegas-visual-renewal Download these 3 dxvk version 2.3.1 (put everything in the 32bit folder in the FoNV folder.

Driver opened dome lid while trailer was pressurized I almost took my head off opening a rib smoker without releasing the pressure first. I was 17 and working at a Bennigans. The press is confusing waste sulfuric acid with garbage and a pressure release with explosion. While inspecting the equipment, ""an uncontrolled pressure release occurred,"" which was when Anguiano-Guitron suffered his injuries. Officials say he was ""struck by a blunt object"" and thrown over 20 feet from the trailer. Dude was yeeted by his truck. Terrible way to go. TSMC will report he died on route to the hospital like always All businesses do this  For these type of plants, looking at you Intel, the questions are: was the person properly trained for the task at hand, did the person specifically follow the training to the ""T"" (did the person stray from the recommended steps at any point(did they deviate) Was the person a direct employee OR a contractor/sub-contract Was the waste disposal truck a porta-john service truck? The article doesn't specify and I suppose there is other ""waste"" being disposed of, but if it was a toilet pump truck....Jesus Christ. What a way to go. Probably not human waste. It?셲 a semiconductor factory, so essentially a chemical plant Arc fault? Not sure what else could possibly explode TLDR: It was a pressurized tank of waste on a truck/trailer having a rapid release event. They say it in the article. From the contractors Ive talked to working that site, they say its a death trap. Another lowest bid transport firm kills another employee? Sulfuric Acid transport truck. Probably an unskilled American worker People have been saying for months that it's unsafe That IS a terrible way to go. Also: this is how villains are created, right?

So it will have to stick to N3P. That would be a break from tradition of Apple being the first (or one of the first) customers for a new shrink node. I might imagine Apple is still among the first for N2; they seem OK to reserve the first spot and then wait for the ramp. For example, N3B had ""volume production"" in Q4 2022; Apple was still the only one to take it up for A17 Pro in Q3 2023. EDIT: fixed the typoes. I think they need to increase the core count to 8 if they want to maintain a decent performance upgrade every new gen. Squeezing more IPC per core on the same node is getting more difficult. Tsmc won't start using high na eu tool until 16Aaybe N3P vs N3Egains are so small, even an architecture tweak can beat that Nobody would say no to N3P if TSMC charges them as the same price as N3E's.

2024-05-20,"ASML TSMC Can Disable Chip Machines If China Invades Taiwan I like to think instead of some complicated technical solution theres just a load of sledgehammers behind break in case of invasion glass near sensitive machinery You can literally just open all the doors to the clean room Yield for a few months would be practically zero Probably even easier than that These machines take tonnes of work just to maintain its not something people can just take and start using Without ASMLs onsite support I doubt they are even usable From Bloomberg News reporters Diederik Baazil Cagan Koc and Jordan Robertson ASML and TSMC have ways to disable the world most sophisticated chipmaking machines in the event that China invades Taiwan according to people familiar with the matter Officials from the US government have privately expressed concerns to both their Dutch and Taiwanese counterparts about what happens if Chinese aggression escalates into an attack on the island responsible for producing the vast majority of the world advanced semiconductors two of the people said speaking on condition of anonymity ASML reassured officials about its ability to remotely disable the machines when the Dutch government met with the company on the threat two others said The Netherlands has run simulations on a possible invasion in order to better assess the risks they added I had an interview with Zeiss a while ago who provide crazy microscopes to chip manufacturers They told me that those things are basically black boxes Any support happens remotely and im pretty sure they have options to shut down if they want to TSMC falling under Chinese control is not important to the CCP I think it is very important to them Its no secret China has been trying to build their semiconductor industry and have lured many experienced Taiwanese engineers and management with extremely lucrative salaries in the past decade to get the ball rolling If they do manage to control TSMC it would catapult Chinas semiconductor capabilities from towards the end of the line to the very front This is basically why the US would not want China to capture TSMC The Chinese are well aware that in an invasion the factories would likely be destroyed It would be a major bonus tho if they could capture them intact as it would be a major boost to China chip technology For NATO Taiwan is important as it represents the first island chain to blockade China and almost form a physical barrier for its navy Aircraft carriers are great but when you can have a natural indestructible aircraft carrier like an island it definitely helps Secondly TSMC produces many of the chips used in western weapons systems Whilst it would be a massive loss to lose those factories through destruction it is much better than allowing the Chinese to catch up with western technological superiority Its been going on a lot longer than that unless youre more aware of how imminent its portrayed than I am Following the eruption of the Korean War US President Harry S Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent hostilities between the ROC and the PRC The United

good segment describing the arrangement a couple years ago which is my other source of knowledge on the matter Aka I have very limited understanding of the full situation Exclusive ASML and TSMC Can Disable Chip Machines If China Invades Taiwan Microchip production in Taiwan is very different from coal mines in the Sudetenland They are both extremely powerful resource hubs for their day and age but one can be dug up with dying slaves and the other requires stability and willing precision Pray that Xi recognizes this It shouldnt be particularly difficult tbh even then if you just purge the cleanroom it would already have enough contamination that it would be near impossible to restart production Yeah I almost did a double take when I saw the title at how silly it would be to be worried about it It would be like someone asking you how long it would take for you to collapse a card tower if someone else wanted to use the table Even in the less strict classes of cleanrooms you get stories of production shutting down for hours because someone opened a fire exit and the machines themselves are so ridiculously precise and cutting edge that they might not even function for very long if you dont have access to spare parts let alone the damage you could do with just a sledgehammer Well in any case its good that these companies have plans for that kind of situation Tbh i feel like they should blow the fabs up in that case just to be sure Nothing in it actually confirms what the title says I hope they dont itll just make technology more expensive I care more about consuming cheap products than I do about Taiwanese sovereignty and so do most Americans If China conquers Taiwan then they win the rights to the manufacturing there fair and square I need a guide for hackintosh

GeForce 6800 XT while it may share a name with AMDs disgusting copycat is far superior in every measure While AMDs army of advanced marketing sheeple will claim that it reaches over 300 FPS in CS2 the GeForce card achieves a much more believable and realistic 2 FPS Its lower clock speed and smaller size make it a superior choice for anyone with a modicum of common sense AMDs testing again turns out to be nothing but a load of steaming horse crap as in realworld tests their card cant even run the game instead shutting off our test benchs 200W PSU Our bench is set up to represent an average savvy users and so AMDs ridiculous performance claims mean absolutely nothing in the real world How about the 1 lows Yes Apple benchmarks be like 2 FPS on an Apple is equivalent to 30 FPS on PC We dont need a 6800XT we have a 6800XT at home The 6800XT at home Nvda puts for earnings Hello everyone I am looking for the nvidia earnings like everyone All the big chips companies were off earnings and lowered their guidance for the future So i think the ai hype was too big And even if they hit earnings goal and lower guidance the stock can go down a lot like 760 per share What do you think Thanks if your replying Why dont you buy some 760p weeklies and report back If he has a price target of 760 he shouldnt buy the 760 strike Most likely not the strike that will give him the best risk reward I wouldnt play this with straight puts though given the high implied move Unlikely you could make money playing for the downside with straight puts given the implied move Youd be better off structuring the trade differently Personally I wouldnt play for a significant downside move simply because even if they miss earnings or lower guidance theres tons of money on the sidelines from people willing to buy the dip These people would likely see even a small pullback as a major buying opportunity I agree there are many buyers on the sidelines waiting to go long NVDA if the stock pullback hard after earnings So my play would be to wait until after earnings get most of the IV crush out of the way and then sell a bull put spread at the first open after earnings Vol should still be higher than it will be at end of that session and you have a good riskreward given that the dip buyers should appear on the first day and then again in the following days If I am looking to get long the stock I would wait for 3rd day because I do think if it tanks posteatnings it drifts down more for a few days but bullput spread IMO is best entered right after earnings If you want to lose your money just venmo me I explain to you what IV crush is for half the money a put costs What do you think  Watch mott capital video on nvda earnings on YouTube He didnt suggest Calls or Puts only showed the potential 9 move So whats the takeaway from that video I will be happy to sell you NVDA 760P How much do you need I will sell you my 10 puts Makes sense buy puts take a chance what can go wrong Yea OP is insane Stock is gonna rip and break above 1000 Maybe even test 1025 on earnings Puts on NVDA for earnings are a common strategy but for a potentially more strategic approach consider a Jade Lizard Not worth playing this one imoNVDA So are my 750730 credit spreads safe for earnings Its the obvious bet Thats why itll probably go up I was having the same idea as you this morning Then I asked a coworker who is a profitable share trader and hes holding through earnings He thinks itll go up So I dont know Such an expensive stock with hi iv options premium so this is like nitroglycerin just waiting to blow up some accounts Bad idea One of the hottest names in the industry its the reverse that would work better wait for a dump and buy calls on weakness If you like puts consider a name that is not doing great like TEAM or SNOW or ZS These are low earning companies that could get hammered on a downturn for their high pe and a likely difficult period where AI could disrupt their business models Oh no bad news came out First of all there is a week left today and we are going to buy again after reporting the reentry Stuck at 168 keeps getting blocked How many times have we failed to break through Texas Instru receives Investment Bank Analyst Rating Update What a pile of manure Under Trump the nation was locked down due to pandemic in 2020 Prior to 2020 deficit was 46 of GDP The pandemic actually ended in 2021 Under Biden in 2022 the deficit was still 54 of GDP god bless the moms of liberty  as bidens presidency collapses under fraudanomics crime and rampant incompetence Check out Lyn Aldens June newsletter on Inflation vs Interest rates It explains why Fed cannot stop inflation caused by runaway deficit spending like we have with Bidenomics The market analysts and investors all come to the same conclusion Disinflation is here forever  They just might be wrong  Being wrong will have massive consequences like a trillion dollar bet gone bad  We are addicted to disinflation for 40 years All asset classes are huge bubbles that have been transparent and will be seen once INFLATION takes hold  WAGES should see a big surprise on the upside soon  Strikes the likes of which we have not seen since early 70s sets the stage for a vicious cycle  This market will not withstand 6 on Fed Funds  IFwhen that happens we drop hard and long the cartel will eventually fail the house of cards never holds longer FED will print money and distributeRate hike are timepass events for the FED After the minute will jump back up cuz the sharks are buying at low NOW it is reported US has already reserved lots of gallium just in case no gallium no chips Futures and Investors Should Not Be In The Same Sentence sorry apples and oranges What are the fed minutes going to say that hasnt already been said I bet there is more opposition to 2 more rate hikes then Jpow wants to admit The minutes is gonna say we still have work to do to achieve maximum employment there would be some hard time in meanwhile I can pretty remember every single word and media still making news on that every week fear this and that inverted yield curve Why dont media make news about each period when interest rate went up the market also moved up as well in past 2 decades Who gets the benefit when there is a dip Not sure why the fed is still the story Maybe they raise rates one or twice but for the most part theyre done Lowered the earning forecast and EPSupgrade the stock churn out deceptive manipulated bullish predictionand the stock will rally Fortune favors the brave lmfao The yield curve is closely monitored by investors scare tactic I like how they all think its about AI somehow completely blind to the fact that after well over a year of one of the worst crashes in 50 years Nasdaq and sp both are rapidly recovering And sure sox got to climb a lot but its still not at its peak from 2021 and if you like sox and soxl youll love mamaa and fngu everyone is recovering tech is leading because tech is leading since 2011 nothing changed dont bet against AI  The moment of achieving a new alltime high It was a micron The second place in US semiconductors wasnt AMD As expected its the mastermindWhether its performance or anything if youre a beauty youll get a double premium The ultimate in God Im going to leave a trace Welcome NVIDIA seems to have gone up
I bought AMD because I think it will go up

Securities Class Action INTC Intel to drive the market Stifel raises Analog Devices shares target citing positive revenue outlook Jpow literally said he wanted to pause Why are people listening to Non voting super hawk Bullard hes a known manipulator No one is surprised by great economic data besides delusional bears TSMC?셲 EUV machines are equipped with a remote self-destruct in case of an invasion Is it like, ""the software locks you out and it won't run"" self-destruct, or ""explosive caps shatter all the critical parts"" self-destruct? ASML EUV machines incorporate hydrogen as a coolant and particle remover within the vacuum environment of the machine. Just allow air and hydrogen to mix in the main chamber and you have a bomb capable of toasting the machine, but not necessarily catastrophically destroying the whole facility. The main hydrogen storage in the basement on the other hand... If China were to invade, TSMC would be a fairly hot target for them to capture. I'd be willing to bet Taiwan would level those buildings and everything in them before letting China get hold of them. the US already mentioned of leveling the factory with US planes in the event of a China invasion. I believe it was Robert O'Brien, a former US national security advisor, that said that. Not surprising, and its why the US government and other governments are throwing money at TMSC to try and get them to bring fabs to other countries. If TMSC's fabs were destroyed due to china invading the economic impact would be felt world wide. Their chips are critical components in a huge number of industries. New fabs take a long time to build and bring online. US and TSMC have made it very clear that if anyone tries to take the country or the factories by force, then no one gets the factories at all.  A 2021 paper published in The U.S. Army War College Quarterly argued that the best way to deter Chinese aggression was for the United States and Taiwan to ?ääay plans for a targeted scorched-earth strategy . This could be done most effectively by threatening to destroy facilities belonging to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company . Each one is built around 30kW CO2 laser. Turn off the cooling water and back up about 5 miles. Next Mission Impossible movie? ?ㄳ?ㄳ Text summary, please. What are all these acronyms? tsmc is the company in Taiwan that actually makes the fanciest high end computer chips, EUV are the fancy laser machines that actually print the incredibly small circuit bits. China has been claimimg Taiwan long before these factories existed. I've been saying this for years, the only reason to take Taiwan is TSMC but there's no chance that the West (or even Taiwan) lets TSMC fall into China's hands. There will be no invasion. What about the ol' inside job? BOOOOOM offline Incompetent arm chair general weighing in.. so you know.. As much as the Chinese dick wave about reunification, the prospect of holding the worlds supply of semi-conductors hostage is much more geo-politically useful. However, the standing position of Taiwan was that the moment PLA troops make land, they'd destroy all their fabs, killing the golden goose.. I surmise the next thing Taiwan would want to is nail as many shipping ports as fast as possible. Then go after vital, hard to repair infrastructure. To be frank, without those ports, China is effectively dead. In the short term, sure the Chinese can just overwhelm Taiwan, but I would think the strategy would be to make it such a pyrrhic victory that whatever they might claim will be ash in their mouths. Define self-destruct, please This popular chipmaker could deliver a positive preannouncement soon Morgan Stanley Hiq Jacko US futures inch higher Nvidia to report this week  whats moving markets what if they raise the rate again market is a natural humor AI probably is bad to small firms but it would be good to mega biggest firms Look at yesterdays chart then look at todays chart  No more proof is needed that this laughable quotmarketquot is a CRIMINALLY MANIPULATED JOKE Thanks The 10AM breaker magically reappears with the laughingstock of the investing world in the red and the losses get whisked out of the system as the intraday miracles return to the greatest financial FRAUD in history and biggest investment JOKE in the world Stocks will fall 90 percent over the mext 30 months  real estate will implode 70 percent The spector of all the Fed lies and cheating to make the wealthy more wealthy is here to haunt them Look out below Lets see what members of congress made lots of money on this government decison  as if it were widens money and not debt piled on all our backs fascism  corporategovernment mafia Bidenomics supporting US manufacturing and national security and keeping commie CCP from invading democratic Taiwan Braindead trump cucks mOnEy lAuNdErInG US stock futures tread water how about the samp Everything is pulling back again Another smashing inaccurate article Well done The market drives oil and gold higher before weekends This is the main trade at the moment totally missed by this site writersanalysts complete nonsense NASDAQ should be in red more than any other index Pause on rate hikes equal pause on lowering inflation Of course all the excessive fiscal spending isnt helping either Oh yes the higher than expected consumer spending and inflation numbers are definitely not going to market collapsing next week as quotrate hike fearsquot return quotBREAKING The average monthly mortgage payment is a whopping 52 higher than the average monthly rent on a house or apartment the highest amount since the 2008 housing crash per The Wall Street Journalquot Intel robust result from adjusted lowered worse than last year pre AI hype earnings resultbetter than Ponzi scheme Inflation is still way above 2 target Real target is actually below 2 to restore damage which was done within the last 3 years Corporate Welfare and vote buying at its best  Who is fooling who How long until we hear half went to exeutive bonuses So much to thosevwho deny the government is giving out any free money 20B could sure buyback alot of stock Its good to see Biden occassionally copying Trumps proUSA economic policies Why is this weird Is this not going down and coming down alone  All of a sudden Profit realization Why the project name Is it Luna",34
